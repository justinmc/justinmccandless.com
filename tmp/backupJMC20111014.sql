Why are publishers using this crap?  It\'s not stopping\r\n    pirates!

On one of your x number of computers that will be participating\r\n    in your awesome Left 4 Dead LAN party (preferably the fastest), start a dedicated server.  This is done under the \r\n    Tools tab in Steam, though you may have to install the tool if you haven\'t already.  Then, make sure that all \r\n    instances of Steam are in offline mode.

Luckily, there IS a way\r\n    around this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You now need to access the console on each computer.  It should just be a simple strike of the tilde key, but console\r\n    may be disabled if you haven\'t used it on L4D before.  To enable it, go to Options on the main menu, then\r\n    Keyboard/Mouse.  Enable developer console here, then return to the main menu.  Ok, the tilde key should open up the \r\n    console now.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Type \"openserverbrowser\" into the console and press return.  This will bring up the familiar Valve server browser.\r\n    You can then find your LAN game and join it.  If you can not join the game, you may have some of the settings messed\r\n    up on your dedicated server, or you can try typing \"connect <ip address>\" into the console, where <ip address> is the\r\n    ip address of your dedicated server.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I hope that helped.

Let me try and write a little about everything that has happened so far since I\'ve been here, and\r\n    then I\'ll be all caught up to keep the updates coming at a regular basis.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I\'ll start with the trip over here.  I began by departing from Las Vegas at 11pm PST on the 5th of May (not including \r\n    my Ann Arbor to Chicago to Las Vegas travel which ended two days earlier), and after stops in Miami and San Jose, \r\n    Costa Rica, I arrived in Quito about 13 hours later.  I slept for the majority of each of those three flights, so\r\n    neither of them was too bad, and I managed to find my next gate at each airport without too much trouble.  My only \r\n    complaint would be having to lug around my super heavy barely-qualifiable-as-a-carry-on carry on, though it would be my \r\n    only bag for my whole four months in Ecuador and I didn\'t want to risk losing it in all my flight changes, so I guess\r\n    the pain was necessary.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Anyways, once in Quito I was forced to wear a surgical mask and listen to somebody lecture me\r\n    and the rest of the people from my flight about all the things I had better not have done before entering Ecuador because I\r\n    would be at risk for having swine flu (or <i>el gripe porcino</i> in Spanish).  Since most of them consisted in one way or\r\n    another of hanging out with swine flu infected people, I deemed myself safe and continued through immigration.  And to\r\n    those of you thinking that this sounds backwards, yes, the people of Ecuador are afraid of ME giving THEM swine flu.  As\r\n    of last time I heard, there has been only one case of swine flu in Ecuador, as opposed to the many many cases of swine flu in the US.\r\n    And that one Ecuadorian case was someone who had just come from the US.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    But back to my travels.  I then\r\n    found my next, perfectly timed flight reserved and waiting for me due\r\n    to my good man &Aacute;ngel in Loja, and also due to the fact that there were a sufficient number of people who spoke English\r\n    at the airport.  This flight I stayed awake for; it was only about an hour long, and it was over some pretty nice\r\n    scenery.  We were over the Andes mountains the whole time, which are really green and awesome and remind me of Jurassic\r\n    Park without the dinosaurs, and even have a few snow capped peaks super high up.  I landed in Catamayo, whose airport is\r\n    basically the size of the one in Jean, Nevada, (small) but with a 30 foot by 30 foot room where you can pick up your\r\n    luggage.  I was grilled about swine flu in Spanish again here by a doctor while waiting for my bag, by the way.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But proceeding outside, I was greeted by a whole bunch of \r\n    <a href = \"http://www.aiesec.org\">AIESEC</a>ers holding a sign with my name, a few of which I was glad to find spoke \r\n    passable English.  I loaded up into one of their cars, and after buying me a delicious coconut/jello ice cream, we started\r\n    the 45 minute or so drive over the mountain to Loja.  And this was my first introduction to Ecuadorian driving.  We were\r\n    flying up this little mountain road with deadly cliffs everywhere, tailgating like I\'ve never seen in the US, and a few\r\n    times even passing someone while there was oncoming traffic so that three cars had to span a two lane road.  That\'s typical\r\n    driving here, and in the city people don\'t really obey stop signs or traffic lights that much either, and everyone just kind of\r\n    periodically honks so that in case there was another car coming, they would hear them and stop.  It is also pedestrian\'s\r\n    express responsibility to stay out of the way; cars don\'t slow down or wait for anyone.  But I guess you kind of get used\r\n    to it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ended up making it to Loja without any fatalities, and I was then given a quick tour of the city.  So let me take the\r\n    time to describe Loja now.  Loja is a fairly small town of about 150000 people in a valley in\r\n    the Andes mountains in the South of Ecuador.  It is the capital of the province of the same name.  The valley has 2 rivers \r\n    that run into it and meet in the city, and it is at about 7000 feet above sea level.  The weather is almost perfect, it\'s not \r\n    really humid, and I comfortably wear a tshirt and jeans pretty much every day.  It doesn\'t rain as much as I thought it would\r\n    either, and if it does it is usually really brief and then sunny again a few hours later.  And apparently, because of the whole\r\n    being close to the equator thing, it\'s pretty much like this all year round.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    The forest around here is \r\n    crazy too, it\'s like nothing I\'ve seen in the US.  It\'s different than the Amazon, which is a few hours from here, because\r\n    here we\'re up in the mountains more.  It\'s really dense green tropical forest, but that even has some conifers, and covers\r\n    huge steep mountains.  A lot of the forest around here is called <i>bosque nublado</i>, or cloud forest, becuase since\r\n    we\'re up in the mountains pretty high wispy clouds kind of just float around in the forest.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But back to the city, it\'s a pretty laid back place (besides the driving), with \r\n    all kinds of parks and squares all over.  Downtown consists of a bunch of narrow streets surrounded by connected store\r\n    fronts on the bottoms of really traditional looking buildings a few stories tall.  Lourdes street is one of the main streets\r\n    downtown, and it has supposedly been conserved in pretty much the same state for the past 150 years or so.  It\'s a narrow\r\n    one way street, basically made of dirt with misshpaen rocks \"paving it\", but with two cobble stone tire tread lanes for cars to \r\n    drive on.  And shops on either side.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    The houses where people live are generally more like apartments because they\'re\r\n    interconnected.  They\'re also completely surrounded by walls and generally don\'t have much of what would qualify as a yard in the US, except maybe a small\r\n    space between house and wall that might be occupied by a dog if you have one.  There are also tons of little shops \r\n    all over that just sell your typical US gas station type stuff, but they\'re way smaller, and I think people run them out of the \r\n    fronts of their houses.  Also, security is really high here: every car has a super sensitive (and annoying) alarm, all \r\n    house windows and doors have bars over them, and every building is surrounded by a wall that is topped with some sort of \r\n    barbed wire esque deterrent to those who would want to climb it.  Despite this, I actually don\'t think that there is all\r\n    that much crime here in Loja.  I don\'t read the paper all that much, but I never hear people talking about crime, and I\r\n    walk by myself to work everyday looking like a blantantly obvious gringo, but I never feel the slightest bit unsafe or\r\n    anything.  Overall, Loja is a pretty cool place from what I\'ve seen so far.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So after the Loja tour we drove around meeting people from AIESEC, including &Aacute;ngel who I mentioned above, which was the \r\n    only person in Loja I was able to communicate with before I left the US.  We hung out at the University for a bit, where\r\n    there was a concert going on, and then I met my host brother Renato.  Later he and I went back to his house, where I\'d be\r\n    living for the next 4 months.  I met the family, consisting of Renato\'s sister Conchita and their parents.  I have had a \r\n    great experience with my host family so far, they very nice and always make sure I am well taken care of and have everything\r\n    I need.  Renato and Conchita are both about the same age as me, so we have a lot in common\r\n    and we get along well.  Plus they both speak some English, so between their English and my Spanish we can more or less\r\n    communicate without a problem.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day I had to give a presentation about the United States at the university, UTPL.  &Aacute;ngel had warned me about this\r\n    beforehand, so I came prepared with a few typical American things to demonstrate and a bunch of pictures.  I found out UTPL \r\n    was having some sort of culture week thing, so the few other interns and I would each be presenting about our respective countries\r\n    and then running a booth during an event for culture week.  My presentation went decently well, I made a Power Point using my\r\n    pictures and wrote a short description on each slide with some proofreading help from Renato, so all I had to do was get up\r\n    there and read from the slides.  The booth was more fun though, a bunch of people asked about my football and a few other things I \r\n    brought, and there were two girls here from the US too so I always had backup if I couldn\'t answer a question in Spanish.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ok, that was way longer than I expected, and I\'m probably not even half way done.  I\'ll continue this asap, hopefully before I \r\n    leave for Manta which I think is Wednesday.\r\n    </p>'),(20,21,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/21.php','Manta','2009-06-03T07:04:23Z','2009-06-03T07:04:23Z','Travel','<p>\r\n    I\'m back from Manta, so I\'m going to write about that for now and catch up with my Catch Up post later.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So, Manta.  It was a trip that most of the AIESEC members in Ecuador were making, with the purpose of having a bunch of\r\n    conferences and switching the national committee and stuff like that.  So most of the work was for the Ecuadorians, while\r\n    us interns would pretty much just hang out.  Me and Pria, a Canadian intern here in Loja, decided\r\n    to take off a day early to have some more time to see the city and the beach and stuff.  We began our trip Tuesday night at midnight\r\n    via bus, first an 8 hour ride to Guayaquil, then a 4 hour one to Manta.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the paragraph where I complain about the buses.  The buses here are crazy.  I already explained Ecuadorian driving\r\n    and road conditions in a previous post, so take that and apply it to a big old bus full of like 30 people, with no bathroom,\r\n    for huge periods of time.  It\'s super difficult to sleep with all the falling apart roads, deadly driving, and\r\n    people randomly coming on and off the bus trying to sell you stuff.  But it\'s super cheap; I think my 12 hour trip\r\n    cost me like $13 or something.  And my bus experiences could have been worse, a fellow US intern had to sit next to a guy\r\n    with a chicken on his trip from Qutio to Manta.  I guess you eventually get used to everything (as long as you don\'t have a \r\n    sudden gringo diahrrea attack).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Oh and by the way, here\'s something to give you an idea of the roads here.  If my geography is right, and it is\r\n    currently unaided by Google Maps so this is just word of mouth, Ecuador is smaller than the state of Nevada.  However, \r\n    driving about half way up it took 12 hours, while driving from Vegas to Reno takes like, what, 7 hours?  So yeah, even\r\n    if my numbers are way off, you get the point.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And before I get too far into this, let me explain Manta.  Manta is a smallish town on the coast in the province of Manab&iacute;,\r\n    close to the center of the country latitude wise.  Most of the people there survive on the fishing industry, though it\r\n    does have a decent amount of tourism going on as well.  Almost all the tourists are Ecuadorian though I think, because\r\n    I only saw one two other foreigners there (besides AIESEC interns), and they were your typical gringo backpackers.  It\r\n    also used to have a US military base on the North side of town, but Rafael Correa, el presidente, made all the troops\r\n    leave just a few months ago for whatever reason.  The terrain around Manta is <i>manglar</i>, which wordreference.com\r\n    told me earlier today translates to mangrove forest, but I don\'t know how accurate that is.  Anyway, it\'s much more dry\r\n    and hot than Loja, and the forest is really thick dry shrubs like 3 meters tall (I\'m trying to get more used to metrics here),\r\n    dotted with these big green barked trees that are pretty crazy.  But the terrain changes so quickly here wherever you go,\r\n    only about 40 minutes out of town is also damper bamboo forest and stuff.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    Ok we arrived in Manta at around 1pm, took a taxi to Tarqui (the more fish oriented part of town), and went cheap hotel room\r\n    shopping.  We eventually settled with Hostal Playita Mia at $10 a night split between the two of us.  Then we went exploring,\r\n    heading more into town instead of to the beach at first because our taxi driver told us that the beach in Tarqui was \r\n    contaminated.  The market was pretty cool, lots of fruit and fish and stuff.  We ironically ended up eating at a Chinese\r\n    restaurant in the market, and it was not bad, I was starving.  Then we grabbed a taxi and went to the other beach, La \r\n    Playa Murci&eacute;lago, which the driver assured me was not contaminated like the one by our hotel.  He was right, it was a really\r\n    nice beach, with calm waves, not a lot of people, and perfect temperature water.  We even managed to get a guy at a tourist\r\n    info place nearby to agree to give us a tour of Manta the next day for only $10, using his car, for like 5 hours.  This was\r\n    mostly due to Pria\'s amazing haggling skills.  She speaks very little Spanish, but she was taking people for all they were\r\n    worth the whole trip with her story about how we were just poor \"estudiantes\" on \"intercambio\".  I was taking notes the \r\n    whole time, I am the biggest target for getting ripped off because I look like such a gringo and I can\'t argue with people\r\n    to save my life.  But anyways, we then made our way back to the hostal on foot, getting a good feel for Manta on the way\r\n    and seeing some more marketish type places on our way.  We took another taxi to the mall that night to get some chow and\r\n    see a movie.  We saw A Night at the Museum 2, which lucky for us was in English and just had Spanish subtitles.  We then \r\n    called it a night and took a taxi back to the hostal to get some much needed sleep after spending the previous night \r\n    travelling.  The $10 hostal beds felt great.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day the other AIESEC people were coming in the afternoon, so we had to get in some last cool stuff on our own\r\n    before we had a more strict schedule.  We grabbed breakfast at a panader&iacute;a in the market and went back to our hostal\r\n    to meet our tour guide from the day before.  He was surprisingly only about 5 minutes late, making him one of the most\r\n    punctual Ecuadorians I\'ve met so far.  He started off our tour by showing us the north side of town and the old US \r\n    military base that I mentioned before.  Then we went back to la playa Tarqui and found out why it was contaminated.  Tarqui\r\n    is where all the fish business happens, including a huge fish market and a shipyard, as in big wooden ships being built, all\r\n    right there on the beach.  It\'s also where all the fishermen unload their day\'s catch, so the beach is filled with people\r\n    cleaning fish and trucks driving to pick up the fish.  There were crazy different kinds of fish too, I saw a few rays, and\r\n    even one shark being hacked up by a guy on the beach.  Another guy was carrying a big bucket of fish from a boat to a truck,\r\n    and every time he got a load he had to run as fast as he could to the truck while these big birds dove down and tried to take\r\n    fish out of the bucket.  It was really cool, just seeing this small local community in action was awesome.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Continuing on our tour, we checked out a few churches, which always seem to be some of the nicest buildings in their given\r\n    neighborhoods in Ecuador.  One had a plane crash into it a few years back, and it even took alot of the surrounding\r\n    neighborhood out as well.  But it was all rebuilt now.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We got lunch back near the fish market, at a restaurant on the beach.  It was pretty good seafood, mine was some kind of\r\n    fish that was fried whole and still had its eyeballs and all.  And we were only interrupted a few times by guys trying\r\n    to sell us bootleg dvds and hats and stuff.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We negotiated with our tour guide to extend our tour to Montecristi, a small town about 15 minutes away that we kept hearing\r\n    a lot about.  After seeing the university in Manta, including the electrical engineering deptartment, and meeting a tourism \r\n    professor because our tour guide seemed to know everyone in town, we headed to Montecristi.  We passed a Starkist tuna\r\n    packaging place and a coffee packaging factory, and stopped at the museum that overlooks the town.  We didn\'t go all the way\r\n    in, we only saw a big statue of some general from back when the local region was fighting for independence from Spain, but \r\n    the view of the town was really cool and I got some good pictures.  We then headed down into town where there was a whole bunch of shops\r\n    selling hats and tons of things made from hat-like material.  One shop owner turned out to be a kind of coin collector and\r\n    was super syked when accidentally given a Canadian quarter by Pria.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Adding to our tour amendments, we then told the guy to take us to our new hotel, where we were to be meeting the other\r\n    AIESEC people in a few hours.  It was a good fourty minutes away, to the south of town, but he was more than happy to take\r\n    us as long as we payed.  The hotel ended up being a hotel/farm in the middle of a manglar with no civilization (or beach) that close nearby,\r\n    but when we arrived it looked pretty nice so we weren\'t exactly upset after our last hotel.  However, after the dude dropped us off, we went to check in\r\n    to the hotel but were told that the AIESEC reservation was for Saturday.  And it was Thursday.  After battling to find service\r\n    outside the hotel since its phones had been disconnected, we were able to make a few phone calls and determine that we were\r\n    actually staying at this hotel only on Saturday as the guy had told us, and we had a different hotel that was actually in\r\n    Manta for the next two nights.  Typical result of gringos trying to plan things in advance in Ecuador.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We found ourselves unable to call a taxi for whatever reason, so with the help of a really nice guy at the front desk we\r\n    set out for the bus stop.  Which actually didn\'t seem that bad, since we were told a taxi from there to Manta would cost\r\n    $10 while the bus only costs 50 cents.  While waiting near the highway for the bus to arrive at some unknown time, a truck\r\n    jammed with people stopped as it was leaving the hotel farm and asked us if we wanted a ride to Manta.  We accepted (sorry\r\n    Mom), and it actually turned out to be a pretty lucky deal.  We got to sit in the cab and not in the bed, two of the guys\r\n    turned out to be the owner and son, and the son had lived in the US a while a spoke English.  They dropped us off at our\r\n    hotel for free, and we were relieved to find some AIESEC people there meaning that we were at the right place.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    A really nice AIESEC Manta guy named Freddy, who ended up being like our local Manta friend and going everywhere with us for\r\n    the rest of the trip, took us around near the hotel and back down to Murci&eacute;lago.  We ran into our AIESEC Loja crew randomly\r\n    on the beach there, and then we all went back to the hotel.  I met a whole bunch of really cool people here: AIESECers from\r\n    all over the country and interns from all over the world, and just about all of them kept offering for us to come visit them\r\n    in there respective Ecuadorian city or other country, so I now have all kinds of friends that owe me a bed and a tour.  There\r\n    were interns from the Colombia, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, Canada, the US, Holland, Russia, and Finland, if I remember\r\n    them all.  Crazy.  That\r\n    night we went down to the beach for a beach party, which was pretty cool because there wasn\'t hardly anyone else around and\r\n    we had a fire and speakers all.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day and for most of the trip all of the official AIESEC people were in conferences, so all the foreign interns pretty much just hung out\r\n    together.  Me, Pria, and Sam (a Loja intern from the University of Colorado at Boulder) took the long walk down to the beach that morning,\r\n    with towels, sunglasses, sunscreen and everything, looking like the most blatantly obvious tourist gringos that Manta had ever seen.\r\n    But we only got yelled at once, and the beach was fun, I got to full out swim this time.  Freddy ended up popping up out of\r\n    nowhere and hanging out with us too.  And to add to my gringo appearance,\r\n    I got pretty decently sunburnt.  I don\'t even know what was up with that, I was without a shirt for like 1 hour, and I used sunscreen.\r\n    But anyways, after that we chilled at the hotel until there was another party that night, but at the hotel this time.\r\n    The conference stuff took forever though, and I ended up calling it a night at around 1, abandoning the hors d\'oeuvres\r\n    (yeah, I had to look up how to spell that word) that I had been waiting for them to serve all night.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>    \r\n    I was up around 8 the next morning, along with everyone else, though the music from the party didn\'t stop until 5am the\r\n    night before.  Those Ecuadorian AIESECers are beasts, they\'re working this whole time too with all the conferences they\r\n    have to go to.  Us interns all headed to our special hotel that morning, the one I had already visited on accident.  First\r\n    we checked out the animals they had there, including a bunch of birds, some monkeys, and ostriches.  A few people went\r\n    horseback riding too, but I was too busy getting whooped up on at soccer by some Ecuadorians at the time.  Later I had to\r\n    miss a short beach trip due to my sunburns, but I used the time to catch up on some sleep, take some more pictures, and\r\n    hang out in a hammock, so it wasn\'t too heart breaking.  That night we went back to the old hotel for yet another party,\r\n    and a new Loja intern from the US named Demetri even showed up, straight from his arrival in Quito.  Me and Sam made sure\r\n    to show him the ropes in Ecuador, such as what ch&eacute;vere means and how there are musical garbage trucks.  After the party, we\r\n    rode a bus back to the special intern farm hotel.  When I was just about to get into bed, I noticed a massive spider, as\r\n    in just short of being tarantual size, chilling right next to my pillow.  Sam\'s attempt at killing it with a towel didn\'t\r\n    work and it got away, so I changed beds and tried not to think about it as I went to sleep.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day was the day we had to leave, but we took one last trip to the beach before we left.  This one was near the hotel,\r\n    but not the one they had seen the day before and not MurciÃ©lago from back in Manta.  The Costa Rica intern had some 100 SPF sunscreen\r\n    that he let me use, and if that stuff isn\'t illegal in the US then I need some when I get back.  The beach was cool, there\r\n    were all kinds of kite surfers and I got more good pictures.  We then headed back to the original hotel, and all the Loja/Guayaquil\r\n    interns decided to sneak out early IN ORDER TO MAKE IT TO WORK ON TIME IN THE MORNING.  Yeah, remember it\'s a 12 hour bus\r\n    ride.  We grabbed a few Loja AIESECers who wanted out early and after saying bye to all our awesome new friends, we went\r\n    to the terminal to start our voyage home. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The bus ride was about the same this time around.  We arrived in Loja at 6am, just enough time for me to run home and grab\r\n    a few minutes of sleep before I had to be at work at 8:30.  Other than that, the trip was great, and now I \r\n    feel a lot more confident about getting around Ecuador on my own.  We\'re trying to plan a weekend trip to Cuenca soon, that would\r\n    be pretty awesome especially because the bus ride is much shorter.  But in the mean time I\'ll try and post that Catch Up\r\n    Part 2 post, and then I\'ll be all caught up to start writing things in order. \r\n    <p>     \r\n    And lastly, yes, I\'ve been having an awesome time in Ecuador so far.  \r\n    Several times since I\'ve\r\n    been here now I\'ve had to check myself and just be like, \"Ok, I\'m in Ecuador now, in the rain forest/beach/mountains, speaking\r\n    Spanish with people from all over the world.  At this time a few months ago, I would have been barracaded in the basement of a library\r\n    with a foot of snow on the ground outside, not having eaten, slept, or seen the sun or a girl in waay too long.\"  Ok maybe it\'s\r\n    not that drastic, but life in \r\n    Ecuador is great.\r\n    </p>'),(21,22,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/16.php','Catch Up, Part 2','2009-06-08T07:04:23Z','2009-06-08T07:04:23Z','Travel','<p>Ok, so I left off with my USA presentation on my first full day in Ecuador, Thursday the 7th of May.</p>\r\n<p>The next day I started work at Fundaci&oacute;n Ecologica Arcoiris.  I dressed up in a tie and all, and F&aacute;tima, a new friend from AIESEC     came to get me at my house and take me there and make sure everything was ok with the job.  The tie ended up being a     bit too professional, everyone there was so laid back.  But no regrets, I wanted to show them I was serious and could really do a lot of     things to help them out.  Nobody spoke English there though, so the laid backness did help me not feel     entirely out of place.  F&aacute;tima helped set me straight on everything I needed to know about the job, and     then she left and I got my first assignment: completely redesign the website.  I was excited about that,     I really had no constraints because they all seemed to hate the old website so much that they wanted to     change everything.</p>\r\n<p>Now let me jump into the future and explain how that has been going.  I have been putting A LOT of time     into the website these past few weeks I\'ve been working.  My new design as of now uses the majority of     the text and structure from the old site so I didn\'t have to worry about constantly having people     proofread my Spanish right off the bat, but everything is much improved.  There were so many sloppily done, confusing     things from the old site, and they are all fixed now.  I redid everything from the ground up too, and      the appearance is entirely different and much better looking.  I think I kept the logo and that was it.     It still needs a bit of prettifying I think, and hopefully I can do that with some input from coworkers     and some more photos which Arcoiris has tons of but I have none.  I also have a few ideas of cool     completely new things I want to add once I have a fully working product.  As of this writing I have the whole     thing done except for a tiny bit more translating to do for the English version, since the old site was     lacking tons of English content.  Then I just have to clean up a few ugly remnants from the old website     before I launch version 1.  This is by far the nicest looking and most complex website I\'ve done, which     isn\'t saying much considering I only have about a year of html under my belt, and by the looks of this     blog (I\'ll upgrade it when I get the chance), but I\'m still pretty excited.</p>\r\n<p>Ok, so back in the past, I actually didn\'t do any work on the website at all on my first day of work.     After meeting and talking with my &quot;equipo&quot; consisting of two really cool people named &Aacute;ngel and Paola,     us three just decided to go out and get a caf&eacute;.  This is usually a small meal consisting of the ever     popular coffee, and something small like a tamal or some bread.  I had an huma, which is one of my     favorite Ecuadorian foods now.  It\'s like a corn tamal but it\'s a little bit sweet, and      it\'s eaten for breakfast sometimes too.  Then &amp;Aacute;ngel had something else for us to do to finish off the     day.  Some guy had borrowed one of the Arcoiris trucks and wrecked it, and now he was refusing to pay     for the damage, so we had to go find the dude and see what was up.  Good task for the first day at     work.  We drove around and ended up finding the truck, but after asking around for where the guy who     was driving it was, it turned out he was nowhere near so we gave up and went home.  And to add to this     story, I actually had no idea what we were doing for the majority of the trip until &Aacute;ngel finally     explained the situation to me.  That happens a lot to me in Ecuador, I\'ll just be following people     around with no idea where we are going or why.  It\'s kind of fun to all of a sudden find out that     you\'re tracking down someone who wrecked your truck, though.</p>\r\n<p>That weekend I hung out in Loja.  I went to a bar for the first time in my life since you only have     to be 18 here.  And now that I think of it, my host brother was there as well, and he just turned     18 yesterday so I guess they\'re not even really that strict about it.  It was pretty fun though,     it was me, Pria, and a bunch of Ecuadorians, and just our attempt at communicating in a crazy mix of     Spanish, English, and French was hilarious.</p>\r\n<p>I also went hiking with my host brother and one of his friends up a mountain near the house that weekend.  That was     my first taste of the craziness of the forest and mountains around here.  And at the top of the     mountain we climbed was a castle, but a little bit newer than the medieval kind since it was actually     a recent attempt at building what     would have been a really cool restaurant and lookout place above the city, but unfortunatel cash     ran out before it was finished and now it\'s abandoned.  You could get inside easily though, and we     went all over in it, it was pretty fun, and there were some great views.  We also saw several young     Ecuadorian couples hanging out and enjoying the scenery haha, they\'re super romantic here.</p>\r\n<p>I began work on the website the next week, but I also got to do some fun stuff too.  &Aacute;ngel and Paola     invited me to come with them to the Arcoiris reserve in the San Francisco cloud forest in Podocarpus     National Park.  It\'s a pretty cool place, there is a really nice house there in the forest that     Arcoiris uses for various activities and stuff.  And surrounded the house are huge mountains with     clouds floating around in the trees.  The house here is only about an our west of the Amazon.     I found out why the heck we were there long into the trip again as is typical for me in     Ecuador, which was to fix the water supply to the house.  This consisted of carrying abunch of tools     and stuff about a kilometer from the house to a stream, where there was a water tank that was supposed     to be collecting the water.  Yeah, that was the house\'s water system.  It had been messed up by rain     though, which had changed the stream enough to make it not flow into the tank anymore.  This is     understandable considering the amount of landslides you see covering Ecuadorian highways as tractors     scramble to clear them.  We worked there in the mud for a few hours, building a dam and digging out the     stream to flow into the correct place.  It was really fun and the forest was cool, though I did get     eaten alive by mosquitos.  No yellow fever yet though.  We went to a really small town nearby, as in     no more than a dozen buildings and some delicious, straight from the farm style food before calling     it a day.</p>\r\n<p>The next weekend I got to see la Puerta de la Ciudad , a pretty big landmark in Loja.  It\'s basically the     city gates as the name implies, like a castle with a gate that a road goes through, and several     artsy type things around, like a Don Quixote and Sancho statue.  I went with Renato and AIESEC &Aacute;ngel up to the top and saw the view,     and also checked out an art gallery on the inside.</p>\r\n<p>That weekend was also Pria and my welcome parties, which consisted of a pretty cool trip to      Malacatos and Vilcabamba.  Vilcabamba is a decently well known town; it\'s called the &quot;Valley of     Longetivity&quot; because the perfect climate and small village lifestyle and diet supposedly contribute to make the people there     easily live to be 100 years and older.  Malacatos is a smaller town nearby where one of the AIESECers     named Paola lives in a pretty sweet farm style house.  We took a bus there in the morning, which cost     90 cents if I remember correctly, and proceeded to walk around the centro.  We went to a park and hung     out for awhile, and there were orange and banana trees all over.  We also saw a place that takes sugar     cane and makes this hard candy out of it that the area is known for, though unfortunately it wasn\'t      producing at that moment.  Later we headed to Paola\'s house and hung out there for the rest of the     day, relaxing in hammocks and playing a bunch of crazy games, including an Ecuadorian card game     called La Burra Nerviosa.</p>\r\n<p>At around dusk we all crammed into cars and drove to Vilcabamba.  We stopped at this place overlooking     the valley that sold sugar cane juice, which is really good and actually dark green.  It\'s more     like fruit juice and not really the sugar water I pictured it as at first.  That was cool though,     just sitting there looking out over Vilcabamba at sunset with a few wisps of clouds floating around     the valley.  We continued down to Vilcabamba and walked around a bit before getting some dinner.  Then     we crammed back into the cars and took an uncomfortable drive back to Loja.</p>\r\n<p>Concluding the weekend, Sam, the new intern from Boulder, Colorado, arrived.  Me, him, and a bunch of     AIESECers all went to Jipiro Park on Sunday, which is a really cool place.  It was packed with people,     and all kinds of stuff like a lake, a skatepark, 50 cent horseback riding, and mini replicas of world     land marks as playgrounds.  And tons more.  We hung out and played some freeze tag before heading home     at dusk, but I definitely want to go back there again.</p>\r\n<p>The next week was back to work on the website, but once again I lucked into being able to travel and do     some more fun stuff.  I was working in the office one day like usual, except that &Aacute;ngel wasn\'t around     for whatever reason.  This is typical though, he\'s always traveling and meeting people and stuff.     Anyway, the girl at the front desk called the phone in the room where I work and told me that I was     needed by someone to translate something, which &Aacute;ngel had approved of, and I would be picked up in     a half hour or so.  Well that was the end result of the conversation, it was actually my first time     talking to someone on the phone in Spanish and it was much more difficult than I thought.  It was     pretty embarassing too seeing as the whole Arcoiris building is pretty tiny and I probably could     have gotten up and walked to her desk in a fourth the time it took us to struggle through a phone     conversation.  But I figured it out, and a half an hour later I walked outside expecting to see &Aacute;ngel     there waiting to pick me up.  Instead there was a guy who I had never seen before, but he seemed be     expecting me so I got in the car with him (sorry again Mom).  We started driving, and I quickly learned     that not only was &Aacute;ngel not going to be waiting for me at our destination, but this guy didn\'t even know     who &Aacute;ngel was.  I asked where we were going and he told me Catacocha, which did not sound like an office     building 10 minutes away like I was expecting.  It turned out to be a small town about two hours away.</p>\r\n<p>We arrived after passing a few of those highway landslides and plenty of livestock hanging out on the     road, and the place ended up being a rural center for developing the relations between Ecuadorians     and Peruvians in the border regions.  They set me up in a room with a computer connected to a projector,     and for the rest of the day I translated their several pages long document as the eight or so other     guys in the room yelled out things to me in Spanish about what each word meant.  They were actually a     bunch of really cool guys, and they kept feeding me and giving me coffee the whole time I was working.     The document itself     was a project proposal to a US organization in Washington DC looking to fund something of the sort.     The project consisted of getting students     and other people involved in helping farmers in a border river basin make the transition to more     sustainable agriculture.  Or at least that\'s what I got out of it, my entire perception of     the project changed several times throughout the translation process.  Seriously though I think I came      out with a pretty professional and well translated document at the end of it all.  And I actually had     to go back home that night and finish it at their office in Loja the next day since it was so long.     That drive was a pretty scary one too, there was fog so thick in some places I swear I couldn\'t see     10 feet in front of the car.  And it was night.  But the next day I finished the translation and     submitted it right then and there, which made me feel important since they had that much faith in my translation     to send it straight off without even looking it over, let alone having anyone else check my English.     I hope they get their funding, they told me they would invite me back sometime since I would be in     Loja so long so maybe I\'ll find out later.</p>\r\n<p>That weekend a new intern named David arrived, and he\'s from the University of Michigan!  We strangely     hadn\'t met before despite both being involved with AIESEC, but it\'s great now having someone to talk to     about Michigan sports as the football season draws near and I\'m isolated in Ecuador.  On Sunday I went      with him, Sam, Pria, and another US intern named Carla, to go hiking in Zamora.  We also had C&eacute;sar, the     guy who picked me up at the airport, as our Ecuadorian guide.  And we met some more gringos and a few     more Ecuadorians on the      bus who were mostly volunteers from Loja and company, and they came along with us as well.  We all crammed into a     truck taxi, which took us from the terminal to the Bombuscaro entrance of Podocarpus National Park.     Zamora is in the Amazon as I stated, so we were right in the middle of the rain forest.  And now I know     why it\'s called the rain forest, it was so wet and muddy, and it was pouring rain for half of the hike.     I was completely soaked through after only a few minutes in.  And the hike was awesome, first we went to a     massive waterfall and got even more soaked.  Then we climbed a mountain, which was a decently tough     hike, but at the top there was a great view looking back on Zamora (when clouds didn\'t float over and     block it).  We went back down and came to the Bombuscaro river, which everyone was looking forward to     swimming in due to already being wet, but because of the rain it was rushing way to fast to be able to     get in.  We hung out for a while there though, and there were all kinds of crazy types of butterflies     flying around.  We then headed back out of the park to meet our truck taxi again, which took us back     into Zamora.  We walked around a bit there, seeing the market and their giant clock that\'s built into a     hillside.  Then we grabbed dinner before catching a bus back to Loja.  Sorry for my muddy nastiness,     people who had to sit near me.</p>\r\n<p>Renato was out of town the next week taking some sort of exams in Quito because he graduates in a few      weeks.  And my luck of not getting hit too hard with any sickness due to the change of food and     climate and stuff finally caught up with me.  I still don\'t know if what I had was an actual sickness     or not, I never really had that much of a true sick feeling, but I did have a bit of a fever combined with     massive chills and crazy sweats.  I got over it by the end of the weekend though and now I\'m fine, and I was kind of     expecting worse due to the transition anyway.</p>\r\n<p>That Tuesday I packed up to head for Manta, and     <a href=\"21.html\">you know the rest</a>.       After the trip I spent a typical week at work, since most     of my coworkers were out of town on some type of trip of their own.  Now it\'s Friday, we have Dave, Sam, and     Demetri\'s welcome party tomorrow, and probably a Vilcabamba trip on Sunday for some horseback riding.     I\'m really going to try and stay on top of my writing now that I\'m all caught up.  And I\'ll try to post     some pictures if possible.  Till then.</p>'),(22,23,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/23.php','Caballos en Vilcabamba','2009-06-09T07:04:23Z','2009-06-09T07:04:23Z','Travel','<p>\r\n    This past weekend me, C&eacute;sar, and Pria took a bus to Vilcabamba to go horseback riding.  It was a four\r\n    hour ride in the mountains nearby the town, and it ended up being way more fun than I expected.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our guide was a guy named Holger who runs a little horseback riding place out of Vilcabamba.  C&eacute;sar\r\n    knew him before hand, and he was a really cool guy, so if you ever find yourself in Vilcabamba and\r\n    you\'ve already had your fill of eternal youth water and panela, check it out.  Just start in the\r\n    plaza and wander randomly for 2 minutes and you\'ll find it, it\'s a small town.\r\n    </p>    \r\n    <p>\r\n    After putting on some boots and a cowboy hat to make myself look arguably less like a gringo and more\r\n    like a vaquero, I hopped on my horse Se&ntilde;or and we headed out of town.  At first my problem was that\r\n    Se&ntilde;or would not keep up with the rest of the horses and just wanted to amble around, but a few minutes\r\n    later he had a complete personality change.  Once we got to a more open road a bit further out of town, all\r\n    three of our horses got an incredibly urge to just go galloping as fast as possible all of a sudden.\r\n    Se&ntilde;or would not stop despite all my pulling on the reins and yelling \"Shh!\", which Holger told us is \r\n    supposed to mean stop.  Luckily he rode up in front of us and got our horses to calm down and stop\r\n    running through town.  A few times during this and similar situations on the ride I lost the stirrups\r\n    and seriously was picking out places on the ground to bail to, but luckily Se&ntilde;or would come to a\r\n    screeching halt just before I completely lost balance each time.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We passed by a corner store a bit later, and by whatever chance Rommel popped out, an AIESEC guy from\r\n    Loja who was supposed to meet us somewhere in Vilcabamba after our ride.  His grandparents lived in\r\n    town, and apparently they owned that very corner store.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n	 Another random and kind of cool thing from in town and in the country a bit was that many houses had\r\n	 fresh coffee beans laying out in front of their houses drying.  I had to ask C&eacute;sar to figure out that\'s\r\n	 what they were, but I found that pretty cool that people just pick the beans and dry them and make\r\n	 coffee like that.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Towards the end of the inhabited Vilcabamba countryside we crossed a river on horseback, which I\r\n    was kind of freaked out by at first but ended up being alright.  The water was only a foot and a half\r\n    deep or so at the deep parts anyway.  I took the lead from here, and at this point I realized that\r\n    Se&ntilde;or idled at about 2 miles per hour or so.  A few times we had to stop, but Se&ntilde;or would just keep\r\n    on walking at a super slow pace, again despite all my shhhing and pulling on the reins.  I eventually\r\n    figured out to just turn him to make him go in a circle while I waited.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We went way up a mountain and there were some crazy views.  The mountains here are so steep and\r\n    green, and with the wispy clouds look just like Jurassic Park as I\'ve said before.  And also to\r\n    add to the movie list, The Emperor\'s New Groove, since that\'s about the same part of the world as \r\n    here and doesn\'t involve dinosaurs.  Back to the view, we could also\r\n    see back to the majority of Vilcabamba at a lot of points.  It took me a second to be comfortable\r\n    trusting SeÃ±or to not fall over and send me off a cliff.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After passing a bunch of big cows grazing on the mountainside (but I didn\'t see any llamas), we\r\n    arrived at our destination, which was a pretty massive waterfall.  I got some good pictures here,\r\n    and along the whole trip, but unfortunately I still don\'t have a USB cable for my camera.  We\r\n    hiked back up to where we had tied up the horses and started the ride back.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We went alot faster in this direction to make better time, there was a pretty important soccer\r\n    game going on at the same time between Ecuador and Peru.  A lot of my near horse evacuation\r\n    events happened in this part of the trip.  I started to get the hang of it at the end though,\r\n    I just needed to keep tension on the stirrups so my feet didn\'t come out when we were galloping.\r\n    My back and legs were killing me the next day though, so I think I could still use a lot more \r\n    practice.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By talking to people on our way back into town we learned that the soccer game was still going\r\n    on, and also that Rommel had already caught a ride back to Loja.  We signed Holger\'s wall when \r\n    we got back to his place and said adios to him and our horses.  Then we stopped in some place to \r\n    get lunch just in time to see Ecuador finish off Peru.  After a bit more walking around Vilcabamba\r\n    we called it a day and caught a one dollar bus back to Loja.  It was only an hour and a half ride,\r\n    so no complaining this time.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It\'s back to work this week, but I already have some stuff set up for next weekend.  I had planned\r\n    on making a trip to Cuenca, but I may be making a different trip for work Wednesday through Saturday.\r\n    That one would be to some town on the coast that I can\'t remember, but I heard a mention of Costa\r\n    Rica island, which through my extensive translation of text about natural reserves at work I know\r\n    is south of Guayaquil and therefore not all that far away.  Maybe 6 hours.  Anyways, I\'ll write\r\n    something about whatever it is that ends up happening this weekend soon.\r\n    </p>'),(23,24,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/24.php','Complete Manual Steam Uninstall','2009-06-17T07:04:23Z','2009-06-17T07:04:23Z','Solutions','<p>\r\n    I ran into a problem awhile ago involving Steam.  I always had it installed on my external hard\r\n    drive, which is usually connected to my laptop, to save space on my boot drive.  I then took my\r\n    trip to Ecuador, leaving my external drive at home.  Because Steam was installed on a currently\r\n    non existent drive, it wouldn\'t run (obviously), but more importantly it also refused to uninstall.\r\n    And last but not least, after downloading a new install client, it also wouldn\'t let me install it\r\n    anew on my internal drive.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This could be a massive problem for someone with a failed external drive, etc., so here is my\r\n    solution.  After deleting every last Steam involved file that I could find on my computer and\r\n    getting the same results as before, I realized the problem must be with registry entries made\r\n    by Steam.  And it was.  Luckily Valve provides an amazing guide on how to delete these entries\r\n    using regedit.  Here\'s the link:\r\n    </p>    \r\n    <p>\r\n    <a href = \"http://supportwiki.steampowered.com/wiki/Uninstalling_Steam\">http://supportwiki.steampowered.com/wiki/Uninstalling_Steam</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After deleting these entries I was able to use the install client like normal to install Steam\r\n    on my internal drive and reunite with my long lost games.

I ended up missing the Cuenca trip for a work trip\r\n    to Huaquillas, and combined with finding a cyber cafe with SD card readers we now have Huaquillas in Pictures. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So I actually didn\'t get any pictures of Huaquillas itself (whoops), but I got plenty of my two trips from Huaquillas to\r\n    some islands in the vicinity.  So before I get in to that part of the trip, let me describe Huaquillas and what I did before\r\n    heading out on the two other boat trips.\r\n    </p>    \r\n    <p>\r\n    Huaquillas is a medium sized town in the Province of El Oro, in the south of Ecuador right on the Peruvian border and the coast.\r\n    It runs mostly off of shellfish, crab, and shrimp fishing, though there is also a fairly large market right on the border that\r\n    focuses much more on counterfeit US clothes than other similar markets I\'ve seen.  I stayed in a pretty decent $7 hotel room\r\n    for my time in Huaquillas, and spent the little bit of free time I had walking around the market and the area around the main\r\n    plaza with some Loja volunteers.  And as an observation, as far as I saw there were no other foreigners there at all besides\r\n    me, so I think it\'s a fairly out of the way place.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And last but not least, two things of interest I saw in the town:    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>1.</b> A small arcade consisting of 30% old video poker machines.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>2.</b> Michigan hats being sold in the market, on two separate occasions.  Heck yeah, Ecuadorians definitely know what\'s up\r\n    when it comes to counterfeiting the right US college apparel.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0469.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ok, now the rest of the trip.  Here\'s Puerto Hualtaco, a port in Huaquillas where a lot of the local fisherman work out of.  \r\n    All the boats are like large canoes outfitted with motors, but there are a good \r\n    amount of traditional canoes too.  Here I was leaving in one of the motor ones with work people &Aacute;ngel and Paola, as well as the \r\n    3 volunteers I mentioned who are from the National University in Loja, plus another boat full of elementary school kids and \r\n    some local guys.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0490.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is on the way to La Isla Seca with everyone.  The whole area looks like this, though it opens up/gets narrower in some places.  \r\n    It\'s right in the middle of the Jambel&iacute; Archipelago, so there are islands everywhere and it looks more like a bunch of rivers or \r\n    a lake than the typical ocean.  The forest here is called manglar, and it eats every bit of land with massive tangled trees like \r\n    this; there is hardly any real beach anywhere.  Also, birds like the one in the picture are everywhere.  I think they\'re herons.  \r\n    They sit in the trees and then all of a sudden dive out and grab a fish out of the water.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0499.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here we had to go through this really narrow overgrown part to get to where we were going.  The dude on the front would stand up \r\n    there with a machete and hack away all the vines and branches so we could get through.  As he\'s doing in the picture.  Also, you \r\n    could see crabs hanging out all over the lower branches and roots near the water.  I got to eat one the night before by the way, \r\n    one of the guys on the boat with me is a cangrejal aka crab fisherman and he has a restaurant that we went to.  It was \r\n    really good and tasted really different, almost sweet.  Cangrejal Don Pedro is definitely recommended, if you happen to be in \r\n    Huaquillas.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0537.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is at our destination, in the bosque seco or dry forest on the island.  The plant clinging to the tree is an orchid, though \r\n    they\'re not in bloom right now.  We walked around in the manglar and dry forest a bit, playing games with the kids and teaching\r\n    them about the environment here.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0549.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    That whole white mountain right there is seriously a mountain made of seashells.  Every white rock looking thing is a big white \r\n    seashell.  This was a pretty crazy place, there was even a bunch of old ceramic laying around from indigenous people a long time \r\n    ago.  They are trying to turn this place into a park so it doesn\'t get destroyed, and so people can come see the \r\n    archaeological/geological stuff.  Right now it\'s surround by a bunch of more mainstream camaroneras aka shrimp fishermen who build \r\n    big lagoons and stock them with shrimp.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And as an aside, I was sitting under a tree in the shade when I took this picture talking with the volunteers and one little girl\r\n    who followed us around for a lot of the trip.  She asked if we were all from Loja, and when one of the volunteers said that I was\r\n    from the United States she replied, \"Ahhh, por eso es blanco.\"  That was pretty funny.  And after all the kids realized I spoke English\r\n    they kept saying \"Hello\" to me and asking me how to say things in English the rest of the trip.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0562.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the next day.  We were going to La Isla Costa Rica this time, where there is a little tiny fishing village.  The girl with \r\n    the shades is Paola, the other three girls are the volunteers I mentioned, and the dude in the back is some guy who took us in his \r\n    boat to Costa Rica.  And the super handsome guy on the left is not a native Ecuadorian super shark spear fisherman like he \r\n    appears, it\'s just me.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0572.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    That\'s Costa Rica.  We landed around the corner and not here, but the houses continue like that along a water inlet (during high \r\n    tide) up to the beach a little farther.  To the right a little out of the picture is a church, and that\'s basically the whole town.  \r\n    We stayed for a day in a house just like one of those, a bit out of the picture to the left.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0585.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the beach I mentioned, where we landed.  There are a bunch of boats like you can kind of see in the picture, and this is \r\n    where most of the fishermen take off and unload.  The beach is slimy and full of fishing junk, but I heard there is a really nice \r\n    beach across the way from there called San Gregorio.  When I got back home I found a random pamphlet from Arcoiris advertising the \r\n    area, trying to get people to come on a trip there with the money going to benefit the reserve.  I\'ll bet the place the put \r\n    you up in is the same place I stayed in too, so if you ever want to go on a trip where you really experience some legit \r\n    Ecuadorianness then hit up \r\n    <a href = \"http://www.arcoiris.org.ec\">Arcoiris</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG0602.jpg\" alt = \"pic\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Speaking of where we stayed... This isn\'t it.  I didn\'t get a picture of the exact house I stayed in, but it looked somewhat like that \r\n    minus the stilts, and I was actually standing on its front porch when I took this picture.  That is the water inlet I mentioned, \r\n    though when I took this picture it was low tide.  That whole muddy area is filled with crabs of various sizes during low tide, and \r\n    all kinds of birds trying to eat the crabs.  Including a few cool birds that I think were ibises if I have my birds straight.  We \r\n    sat outside that house all day just hanging out and saying buenos dias/tardes/noches to the people who walked by (seriously, all day).\r\n    </p>    \r\n    <p>\r\n    Then at night we went to a little soccer field nearby and challenged some little kids to a game.  The teams changed a bunch as kids\r\n    came and went, but it was mostly me and two of the girls versus a bunch of kids.  I don\'t know what the people in this tiny village must\r\n    have thought when they saw a big curly gringo playing soccer on thier soccer field.  The game was a lot of fun though, and, ahem,\r\n    we did end up winning.  After that I chugged a liter of peach juice (the only thing the lady at a store nearby could find for me to \r\n    drink besides Pilsener) and went back to the house.  The house was mostly all open on the inside except for some partitions and\r\n    curtains in select places, like the bathroom.  I slept in a bunk bed with a mosquito net, which I was grateful for given the amount\r\n    of mosquito bites I ended up with during the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day we caught a boat back to Hualtaco with two guys, some kids, and some fish.  Then went to the terminal to start our \r\n    six hour bus ride back to Loja.    \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This week I\'m doing some cool stuff with the Arcoiris website involving automatic updating and things like that, which I\'ll\r\n    elaborate more on when it works.  And I will definitely be in town this weekend since there is both a graduation and a birthday I need\r\n    to attend.  I\'ve been working on some minor updates to this site too between other projects, and I really should be done with that\r\n    before too long.\r\n    </p>'),(25,26,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/26.php','Two Jobs, Shaimi, and Ba&ntilde;os','2009-06-30T07:04:23Z','2009-06-30T07:04:23Z','Travel','<p>\r\n    First of all let me start by making a correction.  Remember how I was praising the cyber cafe with SD card readers,\r\n    and I was all happy that I would be able to post pictures now?  Well that cyber cafe sucks.  The next time I went\r\n    in there, the card reader was acting funny and ended up just not reading my card, which didn\'t really bother me at \r\n    the time since I could just try another one the next day or something.  But then I went home and put my card in my \r\n    camera, and it wouldn\'t read it, I just got a card error.  So I went to a different cyber cafe, tried it there, and \r\n    it wouldn\'t read.  So yeah, the first cyber cafe destroyed my card.  Later, before the Ba&ntilde;os trip (which I\'ll get \r\n    to) I even conceded that all my Ecuador photos were gone and tried to reformat the card using the camera, but it \r\n    wouldn\'t even do that.  Right when I started taking good pictures too, I fixed the nasty bluriness just before my \r\n    Shaimi trip (which I\'ll also get to).  Oh well, I\'ve since bought a new card and I\'ll see if there\'s anything I can \r\n    do about the pictures on the old one when I get back to the US.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ok back to happier topics.  I was hired for a second job since the last time I posted.  One of the guys from my work \r\n    mentioned to me that his wife owns a web design company and was looking for a second hand on a few things.  Later I \r\n    met with her, saw what she was working on, and showed her some of my Arcoiris stuff, and now I have two jobs.  Her \r\n    name is Paola and she is actually a very talented web designer; she does some really professional work using a lot \r\n    of Flash and stuff.  I was actually scared to work for her when I first saw some of the sites she had done because \r\n    I had no idea how to do half that stuff myself, but she\'s been really cool about teaching me.  This second job should \r\n    be a really good experience, as long as I\'m able to put in the time required with everything else I have going on.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So that was the weekend of the 20th-21st of June that I got started on that second job.  The next week I started working \r\n    both my jobs regularly, which often times meant being Arcoiris from 8:30 to 6:00 (with a nice lunch break) and then \r\n    heading to my second job straight from that.  It\'s a lot of work, but I actually really like both of my jobs, and they\'re \r\n    pretty laid back, so I don\'t mind it at all.  It also still pales in comparison to the amount of work I normally put in \r\n    during the school year at Michigan.  The only problem is that the other interns always want to travel (and so do I) so \r\n    I\'m often torn between staying in town to get stuff done and getting out and seeing Ecuador.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Speaking of traveling though, I did get to go on a short day trip that week <em>with</em> my work.  I went with Luis, \r\n    the guy whose wife I was now working for, and a few other guys I had never met before including a Shuar guy named \r\n    &Aacute;ngel and his family, another Shuar dude named Washington, and a guy from a separate organization in Quito, whose \r\n    name was also Luis.  The trip was to a tiny Shuar village along the Nangaritza river called Shaimi, for the purpose \r\n    of discussing a program with them that would lessen their dependency on illegal logging.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By the way, the Shuar are a native people here in Ecuador who live in the Amazon.  Their language is called Shuar as \r\n    well, which is much less common than the major native language here, Quechua.  They live mostly in solitary houses \r\n    along rivers with their families and hunt and fish.  The Shuar in Shaimi obviously did live in a small village though, \r\n    and mostly made their living by farming and selling wood.   \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We took off early Wednesday morning, heading past Zamora a bit before taking a dirt road in the middle of nowhere.  \r\n    After about an hour on that road, passing sparse houses in the countryside, we came to the Nangaritza River.  Here \r\n    there was a platform that floated on the water and moved along cables to carry cars from one side of the road to the \r\n    other.  We caught a ride on that with a big truck and then continued on another dirt road on the other side.  We hit \r\n    the river again awhile later and parked there, near a small group of houses and stores.  After getting a bit of food \r\n    and water and hanging out for a bit there, we then departed in another Manta style motor canoe upstream towards Shaimi.  \r\n    This part of the trip was really cool, we were on a boat in the middle of the jungle passing through huge canyons with \r\n    waterfalls and massive trees all around, it was crazy.  We even picked up a Shuar family of like 8 people who were boat \r\n    hitch hiking halfway to Shaimi.  We finally arrived at the village, which was right along side the river, after about \r\n    4 hours total worth of traveling.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We couldn\'t waste time since we had to get back to Loja the same day, so right when we got there we entered a building \r\n    that might have been a school house and started setting up.  Then about 20 people from the town came in and sat down, \r\n    and &Aacute;ngel, Washington, and the two Luises started presenting their project.  I hadn\'t ever even been told the real \r\n    purpose of the trip at this point, so I just sat down and listened along with all the Shuar.  The Luis from Quito \r\n    didn\'t speak any Shuar, so it was mostly him talking in Spanish with frequent Shuar interjections from &Aacute;ngel and \r\n    Washington.  Including an attempt at explaining the carbon cycle.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The project basically consisted of creating an area of reserved forest where no trees would be cut, an area of \r\n    sustainable logging where trees could only be cut at certain time intervals, and providing compensation to Shuar \r\n    families who do not cut down trees that otherwise would be logged.  And that last part was pretty legitimate, they \r\n    were basically offering to pay the full amount that each tree was worth chopped down, dried, and turned into boards, \r\n    each year, just for not cutting the tree down.  Sounded like a good deal to me.  There was actually a lot of concern \r\n    among the Shuar though, and rightfully so since this would be a huge change in lifestyle.  They were especially \r\n    worried about becoming dependent on this new source of money, and about losing the trees that were supposed to become\r\n    protected to large mining companies.  Everyone was always very respectful and formal when speaking though, and towards \r\n    the end I think they started to come around when they realized that they would basically be getting paid more for doing \r\n    less work.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The effectiveness of the plan could be debated, though, but I don\'t think I really have a clear enough understanding of \r\n    it myself to judge.  It would be great to get the people from Shaimi to be able to farm and log trees sustainably, for \r\n    their own sake and for that of the environment.  &Aacute;ngel and Washington really wanted to help the Shuar develop as a people \r\n    and have the opportunity to do things like go to college, and they were very much in favor of this plan and though that \r\n    it was a good step in that direction.  On the other hand it could be basically putting a whole village of people on welfare \r\n    for the sake of saving a few trees in a tiny part of the Amazon, while elsewhere the rain forest is being burned down a \r\n    mile a minute.  I guess it just depends on how it\'s executed, so if the plan does get implemented then we\'ll see what \r\n    happens.  I do really wonder where all that money would be coming from though...  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Anyways, after the presentation we started our journey back to Loja.  The boat ride was equally awesome in reverse, but \r\n    faster this time since we were going with the current.  I ended up making it back home at about 9 or 10 that night and \r\n    crashed.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then that weekend Dave, Demetri, and Sam had planned a trip to Ba&ntilde;os de Ambato.  We were supposed to leave Thursday night, \r\n    and I was kind of ill prepared since I sent emails out to both my bosses that morning asking permission to take off.  I \r\n    ended up not hearing back by the time we were ready to go, but I decided to just go for it since both of them are pretty \r\n    laid back.  They ended up being fine with it in the end.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So Ba&ntilde;os is a town about 12 hours away by bus, in the Sierra in the north of the country.  It\'s right in the middle of \r\n    some massive mountains, at the foot of a volcano, with hot springs and waterfalls all around the city.  It\'s also very \r\n    touristy, with gringos (and people trying get the gringos to spend money) abounding.  It\'s a very cool place though, with \r\n    tons of crazy things to do.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We arrived fairly early Friday morning after one looong bus ride to Ambato and one short one (about an hour) from Ambato \r\n    to Ba&ntilde;os.  The first thing we did was get a hostal, and we ended up really lucking out after shopping around a bit.  We \r\n    settled on Hostal Carolina, with a nice room with 5 beds right on a terrazo with an amazing view of the city, mountains, \r\n    and a nearby waterfall.  And probably due to the high concentration of gringos, it actually had hot water.  $5/night/person \r\n    for the four of us.  Amazing.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Downstairs was a great restaurant with decent prices considering it was in a touristy place.  This restaurant was also the \r\n    first place I\'ve seen bacon or pancakes since I\'ve been in Ecuador.  I had the pancakes two days straight and they were \r\n    absolutely delicious, made from scratch and with miel de ca&ntilde;a instead of syrup.  There have been very few times I\'ve had\r\n     pancakes that good even in the US.   Three bucks with jugo, caf&eacute;, and some yogurt and fruit.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The whole hostal/restaurant combo was owned by a really nice family who was always friendly enough to talk to us and answer \r\n    our questions about Ba&ntilde;os.  I highly recommend it if you\'re going to be in town.  It\'s yellow and on the other side of the \r\n    plaza from the church.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another favorite place of ours was a small Ecuadorian restaurant between the church and the zona de bares called Caracol.  \r\n    Also highly recommended.  Two dollar almuerzos and meriendas that were very good and actually left me feeling full on the \r\n    way out.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Getting back into chronological order, the next thing we did after eating breakfast and dropping off our stuff at the hostal \r\n    was head to the hot springs in town.  I think they\'re called Las Piscinas del Virgen, and they\'re right at the base of this \r\n    waterfall that you can see from anywhere in town.  It\'s $1.60 to get in during the day ($2 at night), and there are two man \r\n    made pools built on top of the hot springs that the water fills.  The water supposedly has all kinds of minerals and is really \r\n    good for you.  The waterfall is also diverted in a few places to run right near the ba&ntilde;os and forms a few natural showers \r\n    which is really cool.  You sit in nice the hot springs, at the base of a massive waterfall, all with an awesome view of the \r\n    city and surrounding mountains.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    At about this time I started realizing I was sick, unfortunately, though it did end up just being a cold more or less.  I \r\n    bought a sweet llama chompa to make up for it and to save me from another ice cold 12 hour bus ride like on the way out, and \r\n    I picked up a new SD card to restore my camera to working order as well.  The rest of the day consisted of walking around town \r\n    and ciesta-ing a bit at the hotel.  We also saw a dude bungee jump off a huge bridge by chance too.  That night I went with \r\n    everyone to a bar for a bit and played some cards before giving in to my sickness and calling it a night.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next day we decided to go on a huge hike towards a town called Puyo, in the direction of a bunch of waterfalls.  We walked \r\n    along the road for the longest time before turning off onto a trail that basically paralleled the road, but up in the mountains \r\n    on the other side of a canyon with a river in it.  After passing a bunch of little farm houses and plenty of cloud forest, we \r\n    ran into another touristy spot at a hanging footbridge at the top of a pretty big waterfall.  There was a gondola to take you \r\n    across the canyon and back to the side with the road, but we kept hiking our little trail instead.  After I bought about 8 \r\n    granadillas (a fruit that vaguely resembles a pomegranate).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    About this time it started to rain pretty hard, and we started to climb pretty high, and combined with the fact that I was \r\n    sick and wearing a t shirt and jeans it got really cold.  But we pressed on, passing two separate donkey caravans coming down \r\n    the mountain carrying crops and stuff.  Eventually the trail ended up hitting a little house in the middle of nowhere dead on, \r\n    with no direct indication of where to go from there.  We spent probably the next hour trying to figure it out, following \r\n    overgrown mini trails all over and trying to figure out where to go.  We even went up to the house at one point and asked the \r\n    lady there where the trail was, but she didn\'t even appear to speak Spanish, probably only Quechua.  But she indicated some \r\n    directions with here hands nonetheless, which sent us searching all over corn fields and other places for the trail (when we \r\n    weren\'t squeezing under the roof next to her chickens trying to stay out of the rain).  By that time we were completely soaked \r\n    through, and the trail was nowhere in sight, so we decided to head back the way we came.  We stopped near the footbridge we \r\n    crossed and ate some 10 cent panecitos we had brought with us before making it back to the road and flagging down a bus back \r\n    to Ba&ntilde;os.  It was a pretty good hike, despite being sick and wet and freezing at times, though it still bugs me that we couldn\'t \r\n    find the end of the trail.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We grabbed a much deserved merienda and some even more needed showers when we got back.  The hot water was very much appreciated \r\n    after that hike.  Not long after that I completely crashed, and slept for probably the next 12 hours or so.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I felt much better in the morning after all that rest.  We ate our last breakfast downstairs and then packed up and headed to the \r\n    terminal.  We ended up having to take three buses this time, from Ba&ntilde;os to Ambato to Cuenca to Loja.  We left at about 10:30am and \r\n    didn\'t get home until 2:00am the next morning.  And as usual I had to work at 8:30.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This week at Arcoiris has been slow, though.  We\'re in the middle of changing offices, so Monday I hardly did anything.  I did \r\n    like the old office, but the new one is cool too, and probably nicer.  It\'s in a house again, and it\'s actually a bit closer to \r\n    where I live so that\'s nice.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This weekend I\'m off on another trip, this time to the north of Per&uacute;, on the coast.  It\'s going to be pretty fun celebrating the \r\n    4th of July with a few Americans in Per&uacute;, but the trip is also necessary.  Since I didn\'t get a visa, my passport runs out the \r\n    3rd of August, and I hadn\'t planned on leaving till at least the 21st.  So my plan is, I\'ll leave the country to Per&uacute;, and when \r\n    I come back I\'ll have the Ecuadorians stamp my passport for another 90 days.  I\'ve heard it has worked before, but I\'m kind of \r\n    skeptical since I went to the border near Huaquillas and there was no one there who cared who left or entered either country.  \r\n    I hope it works.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Update:</b> I have since posted some pictures of the trip to Ba&ntilde;os detailed here.

It\'s in Perl, and free of course.  Feel free edit the code, and really do whatever you\r\n    want with it.  As long as you don\'t claim it\'s yours or anything like that, we\'re cool.  The link\'s at the bottom.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A lot of times I use a javascript file full of document.write statements to write a bunch of html into an html\r\n    page.  This is usually because I\'m generating the javascript dynamically using a Perl program or something.\r\n    Anyway, I often find myself needing to convert large amounts of html that I have previously written into this\r\n    form of javascript.  But that obviously gets annoying by hand, especially when I have to escape quotation\r\n    marks, etc.  So that\'s where this program comes in.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The program takes as input an html file, and puts each line of it into a document.write statement in a new\r\n    javascript file of the same name with a js extension, in the same directory.  It will mercilessly erase any file\r\n    with that name that might already exist in the directory, however, so watch out.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here are some basic instructions for using it in a Unix based OS.  Download the file, and move it to the directory\r\n    with the html file(s) you want to convert.  Open a shell and navigate to this directory.  Chmod the file to 755\r\n    if it\'s not already, like this : \"chmod 755 htmltojs.pl\".  Then run the file, using this command: \"./htmltojs.pl\".\r\n    Read the instructions, do what it says, and you\'re converting html to javascript.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is some fairly detailed text about the program within the code itself, including how to use it with filetypes\r\n    other than html.

Not good.</p>\r\n<p>I took a bus out to Huaquillas Friday night, trying to finally get this Peru thing over with.  My plan was to go to Tumbes, Peru, spend the night, and then come back the next day and     hope that there was some way to take care of my passport thing along the way.  However, upon arrival to Huaquillas at like 4:30 in the morning, I explained my circumstances to a cab     driver guy who wanted to take me to Tumbes.  He was surprisingly very familiar with my exact plans, and said that lots of people come to Huaquillas to hop of the border and get their     passport stamped and come right back in to get an additional 90 days.  So I decided to go with that plan and finish the whole thing in an hour or so instead of hanging around Peru by     myself.</p>\r\n<p>The guy had like a team of people to take me around on both sides of the border, too.  Using his help, I went to Ecuadorian immigration to get stamped out of Ecuador, then across     the border to Peruvian immigration to get stamped in and then back out of Peru, and then back to Ecuadorian immigration.  And then, yeah, after that stamp I still had only 16 days.       The cab guy who was helping me seemed surprised, so maybe it\'s a new thing that they keep track of how long you\'ve been in Ecuador the whole year on computers.</p>\r\n<p>After that I caught the 6am bus straight back to Loja and made it home in time for lunch.  At least the trip didn\'t waste too much time.</p>\r\n<p>So note to anyone out there in the internets who\'s Googling random things while thinking about trying this: don\'t, unless you\'re willing to bribe you\'re way through.  And while I\'ve     got your attention, don\'t listen to the Chicago consulate when he tells you you don\'t need a visa.</p>\r\n<p>Ok I\'m done whining now.  I\'m asking around to see if there is anything else I can do to get more time, but I\'m pretty sure I\'ll be heading home at the beginning of August instead of     the end now.  Which actually isn\'t that bad of a deal.  I will finish everything I\'m currently working on at Arcoiris by then, and I can still continue any left over stuff in the US     if needed.  For my other job, I will actually be much, much more productive working in the US where I have real internet and no second job.  And I\'ll be home in Vegas with my family,     and my pets, and I\'ll get to see my sister off to her first year of college.  And all the other interns are leaving right around now.

I went to the immigration office here in Loja, and they told me to go to Cuenca, Guayaquil, or Quito to try and get a visa to stay longer.  But everyone continued to tell me that I could do it by going to Peru, despite already having tried that and failing.  Later that day &Aacute;ngel from Arcoiris told me that he was going to Huaquillas again that day and that I should come along to try the Peru thing again with him, then I could go to Guayaquil from there if it didn\'t work.  I packed up real quick and left with him that night, even though I thought that there was no way Peru would work after trying it the first time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI spent the night at a hotel in Huaquillas, then in the morning we went to immigration on the Ecuador side (the same place I got stamped out and back in the first time).  The guards there told me that I couldn\'t come back in to Ecuador if I was to leave for Peru, because I guess you can only do that once every year or something.  They even brought to my attention that I had actually lost a day the first time I left to Peru, and would now have to be out of Ecuador by Sunday the 2nd.  And they called me \"meester\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo about this time things were looking pretty bad, and I was about to go grab &Aacute;ngel and tell him the news.  But the guards kept saying \"No, you don\'t understand, get your Ecuadorian friend so we can explain to him.\"  Before I could draw them a bloody diagram of what they had said so they would see that I understood and didn\'t need them to talk to &Aacute;ngel or say things like meester to me, &Aacute;ngel came over and got the exact same speech.  Then I walked away with him, and he kindly explained to me that they wanted us to bribe them.  So yeah, I guess they were being sneaky with their wording or something and that was the part of the conversation I wasn\'t getting.  And, that would be why my first trip to Peru didn\'t work.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI talked it over with &Aacute;ngel, and since my only other option was probably a visa which I had just found out costs $200, I decided to basically set a maximum bid for the rest of my trip in Ecuador at $80.  If they wouldn\'t take that I would forget them, forget the expensive visa, and go back home.  I really didn\'t want to bribe corrupt loser cops, but it was the rest of my trip on the line.  They ended up going for it at $60, and they stamped my passport (yes, that was all they had to do) and I was on my way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI caught a bus back to Loja about an hour later, with up until the 25th of October to stay in Ecuador.  I\'ll be here until sometime at the end of August; my last day of work is the 21st.  I am a bit bummed about not going home, but it\'s nice knowing exactly what I\'m doing now.

Without restricting my self to\r\nsolely using web apps.  And for free.  Here\'s how I did it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was able to sync my favorite software for all of the above tasks using a few featurs and add ons.  The\r\nsoftware I synced was:\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <a href = \"http://www.firefox.com/\">Firefox</a> on any computer using the add on <a href = \"http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/\">Mozilla Weave</a>\r\n\r\n<li> <a href = \"http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird\">Thunderbird</a> contacts on any computer and my Gmail contacts using the add on <a href = \"http://www.zindus.com/\">Zindus</a>\r\n<li> <a href = \"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/\">Lightning</a> or <a href = \"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/\">Sunbird</a> on any computer and Google Calendar using a feature called CalDAV\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nStarting with Firefox, the Mozilla-made add on Weave will sync all of your browser settings when you use any\r\ncomputer with the add on installed.  This includes bookmarks, forms, history, passwords, preferences, and\r\neven any tabs you recently had open and saved.  Not bad.  The software is still in the experimental stages,\r\nbut for my uses it has work fine so far.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo get it running, first make sure you have the latest version of Firefox installed, which as of this writing\r\nwas the newly released 3.5.  Check your version with Help->About in Firefox, and/or go to <a href = \"http://www.firefox.com\">firefox.com</a> to get\r\nthe latest version if you need to update.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow head to <a href = \"http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/\">labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/</a> and click the \"Download and Install\" link.  It\'ll do just that,\r\nand prompt you to restart Firefox when it\'s done.  Now you can follow the prompts and set up your account,\r\nand you\'ll be set to install the add on on whatever other machine or operating system you want and be all\r\nsynced up.  Notice also that the program has a small icon in the lower left hand corner of Firefox; you can\r\nmanage your settings, login, sync, etc. by right clicking there.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nNow on to syncing your contacts.  Thunderbird (a great multiplatform email client from Mozilla) can be synced\r\nbidirectionally to your Gmail contacts, and this can be done on all the systems you run Thunderbird on.\r\nTherefore, you can set up a sort of central server at Gmail, with all instances of Thunderbird you set up\r\nstoring your contacts and receiving updates from there.  Any Thunderbird you set up, as well as your Gmail\r\ncontacts obviously, will all be in sync.  This creates a pretty nice system.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe way I did it was with Zindus, a third party app.  It can sync you\'re Tbird contacts with\r\nGmail or Zimbra, so Zimbra users are covered too.  The only thing I think it misses is you\'re mailing lists\r\nin Thunderbird.  It\'ll get all the contacts in them, just not the lists themselves.  This is supposedly in\r\ndevelopment, though, so even that should be covered soon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJust head to <a href = \"http://www.zindus.com/\">zindus.com</a> and download the add on there.  Save it to\r\nyour desktop or another convenient place.  Then open Thunderbird, go to Tools->Add Ons, and click on Install\r\nin the lower left corner.  Select the file you just downloaded, and Thunderbird will take care of the rest\r\nof the installation.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRestart Thunderbird and you\'ll have your new add on.  Notice the new little black and grey box in the lower\r\nright corner.  If you\'re not already being prompted to set up Zindus, right click that and click on Settings\r\n(or Tools->Zindus in the drop down menus).\r\nClick add, select either Zindus or Gmail depending on what you want to sync, and enter the required info.\r\nRemember to include @gmail.com if you\'re syncing with Gmail.  Click ok, try to sync and make sure everything\r\ngoes ok, and you\'re done.  Note that all of you\'re Gmail contacts are now in your Thunderbird address book,\r\nas well as you\'re Tbird contacts on your Gmail account.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, as I do, you can set this up on a different Thunderbird on another operating system or computer to\r\ncreate a chain, connecting Thunderbird to Gmail to Thunderbird wherever you go.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, you might also find it useful to sync your calendar all across the net.  I use this excessively to\r\nkeep track of things I have to do; I can set up an event wherever I am and know that it will follow me\r\nwherever I go.  This makes it kind of hard to escape your obligations, but most of the time it turns out for\r\nthe better that way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSundbird is a cross platform calendar application from Mozilla.  It also has a counterpart that integrates\r\nwith Thunderbird in the form of the Lightning add on, as well as another that\'s a part of the Seamonkey \r\ninternet suite.  This syncing method works among all of them, with Google Calendar being the central hub.\r\nAnd though I haven\'t tried it, you could even set this up to include Apple\'s iCal.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCalDAV is what makes it all happen, which actually isn\'t separate software at all, just a syncing method\r\nprovided by Google.  Open up Google calendar, and notice the Sync button in the top right corner next to\r\nSettings, etc.  Click on that, and go to the part about syncing with Sunbird using CalDAV (or iCal, if\r\nthat\'s what you\'re going for).  Google will kindly walk you through all the steps you need to get everything\r\nrunning in concert.  Basically they want you to start a new network calendar in Sunbird, use the CalDAV\r\nstandard, and enter some info about your Google Calendar account.  After that, any changes you make in\r\nany Sunbird/Lightning/Seamonkey calendar you set this up on, or any changes you make on Google Calendar,\r\nwill all be synchronized. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd that\'s it; you officialy have all your browser settings, contacts, and calendar info with you wherever\r\nyou happen to be accessing the internet from.  Awesome.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs an epilogue, you may even be able to make this system even more OCD by syncing to your cellphone.  Weave, \r\nGmail, and Google Calendar all support syncing to some types of cells, as you might have noticed during\r\nyour perusal of all that software.  I would definitely try this myself, but I happen to be in Ecuador at\r\nthe moment, and I\'m using a temporary cell phone while my Blackberry is in the US.  If this ends up being\r\nat all feasable for me later on, I\'ll be sure to try it out.  Potential followup to come.\r\n</p>'),(33,34,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/34.php','PHP + SQL = FUN','2009-08-06T07:04:23Z','2009-08-03T07:04:23Z','Websites','<p>\r\nI think I have the majority of the bugs ironed out of my new blog software, pending a few pictures I\'m still uploading on the\r\nterribly sketchy internet.  I swear, I get 10 times as much stuff done in the same time in Michigan as I do here only because of\r\nthe difference in the internet.  But anyways, here\'s what I did with the site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe old site (being nothing but hand-written html and css), was a pain to update and maintain, so I came up with a solution.  The\r\nnew site uses a MySQL database to hold all of the entries, along with some other data like their title, date, category, and a reference\r\nnumber.  All of the files actually on the site are now .php files, not .html, and they all reference the database for the entry\r\ninformation that they need.  That way, any changes made to the database will automatically appear on the website, since you are\r\nchanging what they reference.  Nothing needs to be changed in any of the files on the server.  No FTP is needed, everything is\r\ndone automatically when the database is updated.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUsing this same logic and a bit more php, I can also automatically and dynamically control other parts of the website.  The\r\narchives, for example, print all of the titles, dates, and categories of each entry (or each entry from a given category) into\r\na table simply by looking up all of this information in the database.  The links to the next/previous news item is also calculated\r\ngiven the number of the entry that is on the page.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis allows me to have a complex site with over 100 pages, and still update it all more quickly and easily than I could update the\r\nold site.  One quick change in the database, and all 100+ pages of the site change themselves to adapt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe site can even be updated from a simple system that can be accessed from a web browser, which is what I\'m doing over at \r\n<a href = \"http://www.arcoiris.org.ec\">Arcoiris</a>.\r\nBasically, I can get all the fields from a given entry into an\r\nhtml form using php, and I can then rewrite any changes that the user makes back to the database again just as easily.  And obviously,\r\nI can add an entirely new entry with the same logic.  I\'ll write my own adaptation of this type of update system for this site when I \r\nget the chance.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ve been doing a lot of stuff with improving these ideas as well in other tests.  I have written a php file that can be duplicated\r\nan unlimited number of times, changing only the filename and not the file at all, and have each one still be able to display a \r\ndifferent, unique piece of data.  Like an entry in this case.  This saves me from having to manually edit each file to have it\r\nreference a different row in the database.  It\'s a lot faster to simply copy the file a hundred times.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe way I do this is by having the file look at it\'s own filename, and then call the correct database entry based on that info.  The\r\ncommand in php is:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\ngetname($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]);\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI have even written something to display an unlimited number of entries using a single file.  A whole blog full of entries can be\r\nnavigated using a single php file.  I do this by having the same file link to itself with \"?foo=$bar\" added to the end of it, so it is as if\r\nit was called by an html form using the get method.  I can then, within the same file, use php\'s REQUEST function to retrieve this\r\ndata, and access a different part of the database.  And notice that these are real links; the user could, for example, bookmark\r\nthe location with the get information and the link would always work.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis blog still does not use a lot of this stuff, as I have been developing it while working on the \r\n<a href = \"http://www.arcoiris.org.ec\">Arcoiris</a> \r\nnews system and some crazy all new stuff on the \r\n<a href = \"http://www.turkiball.com\">Turkiball</a> \r\nwebsite.  I\'ll get to it, though.  The point is that after going from static html, to dynamic content\r\nusing perl and javascript, to this php and SQL combination, I am amazed at some of the stuff I can do.  This may not be anything new\r\nthe web, but it\'s new to my tiny view of what it\'s like to develop for the web.  I had no experience in anything\r\nbut html and css at the start of this summer, and I have improved the stuff I can do incredibly just by teaching myself the things\r\nmentioned above.  I\'m proud.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI might get to a tutorial or something over in the\r\n<a href = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/solutions\">solutions</a>\r\nsection of the site if I get a chance.  Maybe even posting some of my php functions and stuff.  I also have a perl program that batch copies\r\nfiles which I might share, and I may write my htmltojs converter file in a htmltophp style.  It would be useful to me at least.  And last\r\nrandom wish for the site is rss feeds at the main page and each category.  I\'ll get back to work.\r\n</p>'),(34,35,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/35.php','Podocarpus Three of Three','2009-08-03T07:04:23Z','2009-08-18T09:57:40Z','Travel','<p>Last Saturday (25/07/09) I went hiking at Podocarpus, this time at the entrance located on the way to Vilcabamba.  I had already been to the San Francisco entrance and the Bombuscaro entrance in Zamora, so this was entrance 3/3 for me.  I went with &Aacute;ngel and Paola from Arcoiris, as well as the other intern at Arcoiris Audrey and her boyfriend.</p>\r\n<p>On the way up to the refuge there in one of the Arcoiris trucks, a landslide had blocked the road completely about three-fourths of the way up, so we had to get out and walk the rest.  The refuge was really nice, and Arcoiris helped build it I was told, but it wasn\'t open since the road was blocked.</p>\r\n<p>  <img border=\"0\"  alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2082s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>This hawk was perched on the roof of a palm leave hut thing outside of the refuge, just sitting there the whole time we were there.  Pretty cool, I just wish I would have gotten bit more clear of a picture.</p>\r\n<p> <img border=\"0\"  alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2089s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>We then headed up from the refuge on our trail until we actually got above the cloud forest.  This picture is looking down just before we got fully into the clouds.  In Spanish this type of terrain is called p&aacute;ramo, which might be translated to moor but I don\'t know how accurate that is.  It is too high up and too cold for the typical cloud forest trees to grow, so it\'s dominated by thick, low shrubs instead.  This is where llamas live, though I don\'t know how many actual wild llamas there are left anymore.</p>\r\n<p> <img border=\"0\"  alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2094s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Now we\'re in the clouds.  It was incredibly windy up there, which was kind of scary with that huge cliff in the picture.  And looking over the cliff is just all white, it\'s crazy.  Every once in awhile I get all fired up and want to climb Cotopaxi or one of the other massive volcanoes near Quito on my way out of Ecuador, but I can\'t even imagine how brutal those hikes must be.  The highest point we reached on this hike was 3100 meters, and I don\'t even want to guess how high Cotopaxi is, but it\'s a lot higher than that.  If there\'s snow and you\'re on the equator, it\'s high up.</p>\r\n<p> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2096s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Here\'s a close up of some of the plants up there, which are really different.  They\'re all really thick and tough, like it would not be fun to walk around up there if you weren\'t on a trail or weren\'t wearing boots.  You can also see the fade to white looking background that was all around us.</p>\r\n<p> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2126s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Now we\'re heading back into the cloud forest, though we still haven\'t come out of the clouds.  That combined with how the trees are all covered by thick moss and other plants like that make it look pretty eerie.</p>\r\n<p> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2139s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Near the same area as the last picture, I just thought this one was cool.  I was messing around with the macro mode on my camera.</p>\r\n<p><img border=\"0\" alt=\"pic\" src=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/CIMG2161s.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Here we have fully come back down into the cloud forest, below the clouds.  This is looking out away from Loja, so the road goes to Vilcabamba and Malacatos, which must be some of those valleys out there.  You can also see how people are farming straight on the side of a mountain, which happens a lot in Ecuador where there\'s not much flat land.</p>\r\n<p>We wound up back at the refuge (the hawk was gone), which was now opening up since the landslide had been cleared.  I was fully soaked, frozen, and covered in mud by then, and had destroyed my shoes for at least the third time since I got to Ecuador.  But that\'s mostly my fault since my hiking gear consisted of jeans, a sweatshirt, and tennis shoes.  As usual.  The whole hike was only about 3 hours long, but felt kind of brutal due to the wind and mud and cold.  The Lagunas del Compadre hike, which I had read a lot about while translating all of the Arcoiris website, is at least twice as long.  I\'d like to do that one before I leave, but I\'m definitely getting some boots and maybe a jacket first if I do.</p>\r\n<p>On our way back into Loja, we stopped for lunch at some little restaurant on the outskirts of town.  I don\'t know if I\'ve mentioned how the Ecuadorians are much closer to their food sources here (less prepackaged meat, more dead animal carcass), but they had a dead pig hanging from a hook right outside the restaurant.  Then they\'d just go chop off some meat and cook it whenever anybody wanted anything.  It was actually really good, not the same as US barbeque but similar.</p>\r\n<p>After hanging out there for awhile we headed into town, dropping Audrey and her boyfriend off and saying bye for good, since that Friday was her last day at work.  They were now going to go travel South America a bit before heading back to France.  I got dropped off after that and went straight for the  shower and a nap.</p>\r\n<p>So it\'s back to me being the only intern at Arcoiris again.  Speaking of that, I\'ve finally gotten the news items I needed from Arcoiris (and improvised everything else myself), so I\'m just about ready to launch the new website now.  I still am working on making my update system more robust and user friendly, but it\'ll be nice to get my hard, hard work up on the internet and doing something.</p>'),(36,37,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/37.php','arcoiris.org.ec Launched','2009-08-06T07:04:23Z','2009-08-06T07:04:23Z','Websites','<p>\r\nFinally, finally, after waay too much time and delays, version 1.0 of the \r\n<a href = \"http://www.arcoiris.org.ec/\">Arcoiris website</a> \r\nis up and running.  It took me awhile to get all the information that I needed out of the Arcoiris staff, but I\r\neventually got an amazingly well done set of noticias which I promptly translated and used my own update system\r\nto post.  And the rest of the stuff I needed I just improvised.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m still in sort of crunch time after launch, fixing and tweaking things, but I\'m really happy with the way the\r\nsite is looking at the moment.  Especially considering how the old site was.  But it has been A LOT of work over\r\nthese past few months.  It\'s probably the single biggest project I\'ve ever brought to completion in my coding\r\nhistory.  I\'m proud.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI\'m currently also making some pretty big updates at the same time however, right off the bat.  First of all, I\'m\r\nchanging the whole site to identical php files.  Only their filenames will differ.  This also involves centralizing\r\nthe entirety of the html into only two or so files, which should make any updates that I want to make to the actual\r\nlayout and appearance of the site very easy and universal.\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, in the process, I\'m changing the navbar, because it\'s kind of sketchy right now, and I honestly can\'t tell\r\nyou how or why it works.  It works, right?  I\'ve been experimenting with Flash using OpenLaszlo, but after\r\nconsideration, I think I\'m just going to go with a simple list navbar.  I want people without Flash player\r\nto be able to use the navbar, and I don\'t want to scare people away with over animation either.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m also setting up some feeds for the news systems.  Atom and rss, for the English and Spanish versions.  That\r\nshould be cool, and some good experience for me.  I just really hope the Arcoiris people use this news system\r\nafter I wrote it all.  I am absolutely content with what I learned in writing it, but still I just hope they\r\nrealize how awesome it is.  ÃƒÂngel asked me one day to allow him to update the site without knowing anything about\r\ncode, but I don\'t know if he realizes how huge of an untertaking it was in achieving that.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, it\'s achieved.  Update any page on the site, or add/delete/edit news items, all in English and Spanish, all\r\nwithout touching any code, html, or ftp.  It\'s pretty sweet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHopefully the rest of my plans go as well.\r\n</p>'),(37,38,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/38.php','Finca','2009-08-10T07:04:23Z','2009-08-18T09:54:51Z','Travel','<p>Today is the Ecuadorian independence day, which I didn\'t actually know about until yesterday, but apparently it means that I get the day off work.  At least I think so, no body really ever told me anything about it, though I do remember on Friday somebody asking me to help with  something Tuesday (strangely not Monday).  So, I\'m staying home.</p>\r\n<p>And since I\'m home (and my family is in Macar&aacute; visiting relatives), I might as well write about what I did yesterday since it was fairly interesting.  I went with F&aacute;tima from AIESEC and her four other  siblings to visit their aunt and uncle\'s finca.  I think the closest word to finca in English is ranch.  It\'s usually a house out in a rural area with some farmland and animals and stuff.  Which sounds pretty much like a ranch, but just because of being so different in the Ecuadorian style I feel like using finca instead.</p>\r\n<p>The place was located between Loja and Malacatos, right right on the edge of Podocarpus National Park.  So out the back of the finca is just mountains and forest with no other people for a long way, seeing as Podocarpus is huge.  I thought that was cool, it reminded me of the massive uninhabited deserts back home in Nevada.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, we met all met up at a roundabout on the road to Vilcabamba, where the bus passes by.  We flagged it down when it came and got on, and paid 70 cents each to ride about 45 minutes out of town.  They let us off on the side of the road there, and we started hiking towards the finca.  After about a 20 minute hike, including crossing a stream via a really sketchy bridge, we arrived.</p>\r\n<p>I met the family who lived there and then got a tour of the place. First we saw the pigs, which they had a good amount of.  There was a litter (correct word for pigs?) of piglets, which was pretty cool to see; they were probably smaller than most cats.  Then there were some dog sized young pigs, like 10 or so good sized maybe adultish or teenager pigs, and then 3 of the biggest pigs I\'ve ever seen.  I\'ve never been to a pig farm before, but I didn\'t even realize it was possible for pigs to grow this large.  I\'m completely guessing, but I\'d say they had to be like 300 pounds or more.  I don\'t know how those little piglets could grow that big.</p>\r\n<p>We then went to see the chickens, where there must have been like 100 of them running around.  They lived in a fenced in area with a big coop type building in the middle.  And a german shepherd protecting them, though he never did anything but bark at us luckily.</p>\r\n<p>Also inside the coop were some cuyes (guinea pigs), which was pretty funny to see on a farm.  They lived like 10 per 10\'x10\' stall.  There was also a new litter of them, too bad they would some day end up like the ones in  <a href=\"http://www.justinmccandless.com/images/entrypics/CIMG1857.jpg\">the picture I took in Ba&ntilde;os</a>.</p>\r\n<p>There were also a bunch of different kinds of chickens running around freely on the farm, and some ducks.  In addition to the german shepherd in the chicken coop, there were also about 5 other dogs on the farm, mostly german shepherd type dogs as well.  And roaming the green grass covered mountains around the finca were plenty of  cows.</p>\r\n<p>After the tour we went back to the house to play some volleyball. Ecuadorian volleyball (Ecuavolley) is different than it is in the US though, as I think I\'ve talked about before.  Basically, the court is significantly bigger, and the net is higher, and it\'s almost always 3 on 3.  This changes the game a lot though, as you pretty much can\'t spike or block, and the best way to score is either to lob it to a  spot where the other team isn\'t covering, or drill it to the far away back of the court.</p>\r\n<p>So my huge height advantage over everyone else, which would have normally made me destroy against these guys in regular volleyball, was basically insignificant.  I could still jump high enough to get a bit of my hand above the net, so I could occasionally make longish semispikes if the ball was placed correctly.  This was usually my team\'s strategy still though, to get me setup as the third touch to semispike.  We were playing with a soccer ball by the way, so that made spiking even more difficult and just bumping the ball on the giant court painful.</p>\r\n<p>It was a lot of fun, though, especially since I rarely get to play any sports here in Ecuador.  But these Ecuadorians don\'t know what they\'re missing, the absolute best part of volleyball is spiking the ball right through someone\'s block.</p>\r\n<p>We also played a game of soccer, which I am much worse at than  volleyball, especially on the small dirt field we played on where I couldn\'t really ever use my speed to help me.  I faired pretty decently though, usually my I-must-win-at-everything-always attitude helps me do ok in most things even when my skill doesn\'t.  I really need to work on my ball handling though.</p>\r\n<p>After having a really good orange off of one of their trees, we went hiking up the mountain behind their house, towards Podocarpus.  We took one of the dogs with us, named Conan, who kept trying to carry massive tree sized sticks around with him.  We also brought F&aacute;tima\'s cousin, a little girl who was probably only like 6 or so.  I like Ecuadorian kids because their Spanish is usually at about the same level as mine.</p>\r\n<p>First we passed their garden and farm, where they had lettuce,  cebolla (red onions but that don\'t taste oniony), aj&iacute; (peppers), and a bunch of other vegetables and stuff.  They also had a lot of  plants growing specifically to feed the animals, which I was told was called hierba.</p>\r\n<p>From what I was hearing, the forest up ahead was pretty cool, there was a cave, a waterfall, and mountain crabs.  I actually saw a mountain crab in Ba&ntilde;os during my hike, but I think I forgot to mention it.  Yeah, there are crabs that live in the mountins here. They were even saying that one of them had seen a spectacled bear in the forest there, which from what I\'ve learned by translating stuff at Arcoiris they\'re very rare.  Anyways, we actually didn\'t make it to any of the cool stuff due to the sun going down, being ill prepared, and being tired from volleyball and soccer.  We did get to walk through the really nice grass covered hills and just barely into the actual forest though.  But we decided to save the rest for another day.</p>\r\n<p>Back at the finca I got some good pictures of the sunset over the mountains.  These were actually the only pictures I got the whole trip, though, mostly because I didn\'t want to look like a complete gringo tourist and start snapping photos of their house and stuff.  They already assumed I didn\'t speak any Spanish without that.</p>\r\n<p>We said goodbye and got a ride to a small town near Malacatos in the back of their truck, which had to go deliver some eggs and stuff.  When we got there we searched the whole place for some chow, but everybody seemed to be out of anything dinner-like.  So we settled for some bread and typical corner store stuff to hold us over.  I got some awesome mazapan though, which is like a mix between bread and cookies sort of.  Like cookies, but not that sweet.  It was good.</p>\r\n<p>We waited for a bus there, but there seemed to be tons of people coming back from Vilcabamba/Malacatos for the weekend.  We let one full bus pass by, but decided to cram into the next one because it was getting late.  I\'ve had some pretty packed bus rides at Michigan, but this one had to beat them.  For part of the ride I had people straight standing on my feet, while a guy hung out the open door of the bus.  Luckily some people got off before we got to Loja, and it became bearable.</p>\r\n<p>We got off at the same roundabout and said our goodbyes.  Next weekend it\'s fellow US intern Demetri\'s birthday though, so we planned on all going to Vilcabamba together and maybe the finca again to celebrate that.  Hopefully I get to see that cave and waterfall before I leave!</p>'),(38,39,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/39.php','Update on Updates','2009-08-17T07:04:23Z','2009-08-17T07:04:23Z','Websites','<p>I finally got my web-based updater software up and running for this blog.

I realized that I haven\'t really posted that much on what I do on a typical day to day basis here in Loja, so that\'s what this post is about.  Sans travelling, giant pigs, or anything out of the ordinary  whatsoever, here\'s what I do on an average workday.</p>\r\n<p>My alarm goes off around 7:30, though if the dorms at Michigan hadn\'t turned me into an incredibly deep sleeper, the roosters, honking cars, and construction in the lot outside my window would have me up way earlier.  I then hop in the shower, which I would normally complain about, but my host family\'s house happens to be one of the fairly rare places in Ecuador with a water heater, and for that I am instead just very, very grateful.</p>\r\n<p>I then head downstairs for breakfast, which is always waiting for me thanks to my family\'s awesome live-in maid, Irene.  Breakfast is typically some bread from one of the many panader&iacute;as (bakeries) here in Loja, though it varies a lot, and sometimes I\'ll have mote (really big white corn) or a hardboiled egg as well, for example.  Also, there\'s always some really good, really fresh juice to go with it.  I think I\'ve mentioned how fresh the fruit is here (as well as the vegetables and cheese), and the juice is made in our kitchen in a blender so it\'s just as good.  There  are some different fruits here as well, like passion fruit, papaya, mango, tree tomato, granadilla, and way too many different kinds of bananas.  Oh, and rounding it off, I always get some sort of hot drink for breakfast as well; either coffee, hot chocolate, or milk.  Overall it\'s a good deal.</p>\r\n<p>Then I grab my backpack with my computer in it and head out the door.  I walk to work, which is pretty close, but we live near the river at the low part of the valley so it\'s all uphill.  It\'s a few blocks up past a gas station, a roundabout with a statue of some soldier guy in the middle, and a bunch of the little stores that are on every corner.  Because of the slope of the city, you have a good view from wherever you\'re at, so I do have some nice scenery of the town and the green mountains on my way.  I usually arrive at around 8:30, though nobody is strict about that at all.</p>\r\n<p>Our office is in a house in a residential-ish neighborhood (the old one was about the same way and nearby, this is our new office).  I buzz the intercom at the door, which what almost all houses have at the gate in the wall surrounding it.  When I walk in I say good morning and give a typical Ecuador greeting to whoever is around (hand shake for men and kiss on the cheek for women).  I sit down in the office I share with 2 other people, &Aacute;ngel and Paola, when they\'re around, and set up my computer.</p>\r\n<p>I then get to work on whatever I need to do on the website for the day.  Which is always determined by me.  I work  completely independently, and nobody else in the office has any clue about web design.  So I basically get to do what  I want, within the loose boundaries of everyone\'s expectations for the website.  There are obviously benefits to  strictly managed projects in groups (which I <i>must</i> find next summer), but I\'ve definitely taken advantage of the freestyle work environment.  I\'ve really, really taught myself a lot about web design and coding while sitting at my desk thinking, &quot;Hmm, what could I ridiculously over design on this part of the website...&quot;  But in the end it really benefitted me, and even if no one in the office ends up taking much time in maintaining the easily updated, news feed enabled beast of a website that I wrote and it stays static, it still is a massive improvement over the  old website and will make them look much more professional.</p>\r\n<p>Usually sometime before lunch someone gets coffe and some sort of food, and we all go in to the kitchen to hang out and eat.  Usually it\'s bread of some sort, or tamales.  There are maybe a dozen of us in the office when everyone is  around, so it\'s not that big of a place.  I still don\'t know a lot of people at work that well, aided not by my  shyness or the fact that most Ecuadorians think that there is no such thing as a Spanish speaking gringo.  I\'m also  the youngest person at Arcoiris, though there are a good amount of twenty something year olds.  The people I have  gotten to know are really cool though, &Aacute;ngel and Paola of course, as well as Luis whose wife I work for in my other job, and even a few of the younger people.</p>\r\n<p>After this few minute break it\'s back to work, until around 1:00pm when people start leaving for lunch.  I usually get back to my house a little after that, and everyone is usually home and about to eat.  As I mentioned before, Ecuadorian lunches are the biggest meal of the day, and everyone comes home from work/school to eat.  We always have some sort of soup first, followed by the main course which always has rice, and usually has some sort of bananas and meat.  It\'s good, and always home cooked.</p>\r\n<p>I don\'t have to be back to work until 2:30pm at the earliest, so after I eat I usually have some time to kill.  Usually I hang out at the house with the family, but a lot of other times I\'ll go walk downtown, or to the park nearby, or something like that.  Or maybe even take a nap.  It\'s a nice lunch break.</p>\r\n<p>After that it\'s back to Arcoiris.  Another round of greetings and I\'m back to work on the website for the rest of the day.  People usually start leaving around 6:00, but for me it varies.  When I get off sometimes I\'ll go to a cyber, talk to my family back home, and mess around on the internet doing stuff I wanted to do earlier but couldn\'t because I was working.  Other times I\'ll get picked up to go work my second job.</p>\r\n<p>Paola (different than the Arcoiris Paola) will take me over to her and Luis\'s house.  Then I\'ll set up in their living room and get working on whatever she needs me to do on any of the several sites she is always working on at a time for clients.  Her favorite thing to work on is the actual appearance of sites, and she\'s a master at Flash. I\'m much more into the underlying structure and code, so together we make a pretty good team.  I\'ll usually get as much done there as I can and take whatever I still need to do home, communicating my work via email.  I should continue to work at this job after I return to the US as well.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever happens after I get done at Arcoiris, I usually don\'t ever get home much later than 8:00.  We eat dinner around then, which again as mentioned in an earlier post is much less formal than lunch.  And sometimes it actually is  leftover lunch, in contrast to how we do it in the US.  After that I might hang out with whoever is around the house, read, or work on some of my non-Ecuador related web design projects.  Then I\'m usually in bed by 10:30 or so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So there you go, that\'s how I\'ve been living for the last few months.  Though it\'s all about to change in a week! The other day Pria and Demetri headed back home, so all is coming to a close (Maria will be the only foreigner left until September something).  Today the majority of the family is going to Quito to see my  host brother Renato off to his trip to Belgium for a year, so it\'ll be quiet around here.  And then next Saturday I leave and begin my own trip to Quito to make my flight Tuesday afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ll continue to write throughout, though.  I just got the FTP-less updating of the Arcoiris  site working on my own blog, so even during my travels to Quito I should be able to write from cybers.  So I\'ve still got a bit of time left, and I have to make it awesome!</p>'),(40,41,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/41.php','Loja','2009-08-18T09:04:23Z','2010-09-13T02:35:17Z','Travel','<p>Another important yet neglected topic.

I have searched long and hard for a good studio to write html, css, php, etc. in, and though I oft find myself defaulting to my beloved Gedit, Aptana is a great alternative for when I want more than a plain text editor. It\'s based off of Eclipse, but you can get it as a standalone or as an Eclipse plugin. I have had a few problems with using Eclipse installed from the Ubuntu Software Center + a bunch of web plugins, but Aptana downloaded from its website and installed as a standalone seems to work fine. Any slight annoyance that I get from these more complex editors usually sends me straight back to Gedit, but Aptana seems to be pretty solid and its very nice having all the features that a studio like this provides.</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/\">Bluefish Editor</a></h2>\r\n<p>Bluefish is a lightweight, simple web design studio. I actually used this a lot as an alternative to Gedit. It has all of the basic features that you\'ll use on an everyday basis, with all the more fancy stuff that Aptana and Eclipse have stripped off. The result is a much faster and more lightweight application that is almost as quick as Gedit.</p>\r\n<p>However, a few things were a deal breaker for me. First, it has a pretty poorly implemented search function that, if I\'m not terribly mistaken, will only find the first occasion of the string you specify. This can be very annoying, and it\'s kind of strange since its search and replace works great, it\'s just the straight search that doesn\'t go past the first instance. Also, on a few occasions I have found Bluefish to save my files in some sort of weirdly corrupt fashion. At a certain place in my file it will insert an invisible character or something that can\'t be seen in Bluefish, but incidentally will cause my code to not work. Only by eventually finding the location and backspacing it, or redoing the file in trusty Gedit, can I circumvent the error.</p>\r\n<p>Bluefish is otherwise a pretty great program, but I cannot be spending tons of time digging for the random invisible character error when it appears, so I have moved more away from Bluefish recently. However, that was awhile ago and version 2.0 has recently been released, so I have a strong feelings that a lot of these annoyances have been improved. I\'ll try it out again at some point.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 class=\"western\"><u>Media</u></h1>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/\">VLC Player</a></h2>\r\n<p>You know this program. It\'s a great lightweight, reliable, play-anything type of media player (especially video). The default Ubuntu media players can be kind of clunky, and if you really need to give these a try if you have never branched out from those. By the way, it\'s cross platform, so you can quit fighting with Windows Media Player too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.getsongbird.com/\">Songbird</a></h2>\r\n<p>Another cross platform one, this program is Mozilla\'s take on a music player. You may have also noticed how the default music playing programs for Ubuntu are lacking, but this one seems to take care of most of my complaints. It has most of the features that a program like iTunes would (while being nowhere near as bloated), and has a lot of cool customization features like all of Mozilla\'s products.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve been using it myself since the beta, and it has become pretty stable and featured since then. If I\'m not mistaken, the Windows version can even play protected iTunes music using a Quicktime plugin...</p>\r\n<p>If you download this, be sure to install the lyrics add on and the music info add on. It\'s really useful having all that come up right when a song starts playing, you learn things about your music that you otherwise would never have looked up on your own. Oh, and this one is not in the Ubuntu repositories so you\'ll have to <a href=\"http://www.getsongbird.com/\">download from Mozilla</a> and install.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://amarok.kde.org/en\">Amarok</a></h2>\r\n<p>If the previous music player was too big or not Linuxy enough for you, Amarok is a good alternative. Yes, it was originally for the K desktop environment so it doesn\'t quite have the same Gnome feel, but it is lightweight and gets the job done in a reliable and organized way. I used this for awhile before Songbird, and I still think it clearly edges out the default Rhythmbox (and iTunes for that matter, if I can compare the two).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 class=\"western\"><u>Graphics</u></h1>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.gimp.org/\">Gimp</a></h2>\r\n<p>If you are editing images in Linux and haven\'t tried Gimp then go get it right now. In fact, you probably already have it since its included with Ubuntu. I use this program constantly, on Linux and Windows, and it handles almost everything I need image editing wise. It can probably do everything Photoshop can, especially including its addons, and it does it all while being free, open source, and much much less bloated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a></h2>\r\n<p>This is the program from my anecdote in the intro. It\'s great fully featured vector graphics editor that helped me realize the value of scalable graphics. Whether you want to convert an existing image of yours to a vector graphic, or you want to draw something altogether new (and be able to scale it to any size perfectly), this program gets it done. Even if you don\'t have too much of a need for scalable graphics, you might want to give this a shot just to messing around with its tools. It\'s a breath of fresh air from Gimp, and you can actually create some pretty good looking graphics with it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 class=\"western\"><u>Random</u></h1>\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://do.davebsd.com/\">GNOME Do</a></h2>\r\n<p>I think I pretty much randomly downloaded this and then was hooked on it.&nbsp; It\'s a simple program that allows you to do a few basic tasks by typing, with the goal of increasing the speed that you get these tasks done.&nbsp; Basically, you press Meta + Space to call up the program, start typing, and press Enter to executed the command on the screen that GNOME Do thinks you mean.&nbsp; You can use it to launch applications, search for files, do Google Math esque calculations and conversions, and more.&nbsp; It may sound pretty pointless, but it can actually save you a lot of pointing and clicking, which is especially helpful for laptops.&nbsp; I find myself really missing its presence when I use a Linux school computer.</p>\r\n<p>As a sidenote, the Firefox extension <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/ubiquity/\">Ubiquity</a> is kind of like a browser based version of this.&nbsp; Another good click saver.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 class=\"western\"><u>Conclusion</u></h1>\r\n<p>Well there you have it, a brief overview of some of the cool programs I have ran into while messing around on Linux. Yes, it may have been a bit more Windows focused than intended, but some programs are just as awesome on both.

If Arcoiris can use the two separate systems though, that works fine.Â  We\'ll see when IÂ get to the US.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe site is back up now, with links to the English sections removed while that part is rennovated.Â  Most of the Spanish text is being changed, so we\'ll need to translate again.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd IE support is a bit sketchy, which is bad, but I\'ll get on that also when I\'m back home.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd some other work with my other job, which I\'ll be continuing.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd <a href = \"http://www.turkiball.com\">Turkiball</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd you never know, maybe I\'ll have time to relax and hang out with my family before school starts...\n</p>\n<p>\nBack to my last day, though.Â  So I said my goodbyes to everyone at Arcoiris as they left, with just me and Ãngel and Paola left slaving away at the end.Â  Ãngel promised me some cuy if we finished the site, which we kind of did, so we then left to eat.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe went to the zona de los cuyes, as Ãngel called it, which is a plaza near the Hipervalle.Â  And yes, finally in my last day in Loja, yo comÃ­ la mascota.Â  I had half a cuy, luckily the half without the head.Â  It was pretty good actually, and I\'m not too picky about food, so I was fine.Â  Kind of stereotypically like chicken, but darker and less dry.Â  And with really tough skin.Â  And \na rat body.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen we went to El Viejo Minero, an old bar in the centro.Â  We hung out for awhile, talking about Arcoiris and stuff.Â  I heard a lot of history from Ãngel, including the history of Paola in the organization.Â  And I heard Ãngel\'s history with Arcoiris, which was much deeper than I thought.Â  I had heard before that Arcoiris was started by a couple students at the universidad tÃ©cnica, and it turns out that Ãngel was one of those kids, 20 years ago.Â  I never knew that. \n</p>\n<p>\nSo originally these students were looking to start like a chapter of another ecologic organization, the biggest one in Ecuador at the time whose name escapes me.Â  They traveled to a meeting to make their proposal, and basically weren\'t taken seriously and were sent packing since they were just a bunch of kids.Â  The only thing they got out of the trip was a tiny book about starting ecologic clubs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd that they did.Â  When they arrived back at Loja, they began talking to business owners in town trying to get them to donate anything useful to their cause.Â  They wound up talking to Dr. Guzman at his clinic in town, the same el doctor that currently runs Arcoiris who IÂ see almost every day.Â  He donated a bunch of furniture, which they set up in someone\'s garage, and Arcoiris was started.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd long story short it eventually grew into the influential organization it is today.Â  That\'s inspirational.Â  If any of my entrepreneurial projects/ideas turn out half as successful as that, IÂ will have done something awesome in life.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a change of pace for this entry, after that a really good band started playing.Â  I believe they were called Afuera del Sitio, based on the flyers on the wall.Â  The frontman was the bass player, which never happens.Â  He did play a 5 string though, which makes them slightly less cool.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the show, Ãngel got to talking about how thankful he was for my work, and the impact the site would have for Arcoiris, and how it ties into all that history he was telling me.Â  He ended up giving me his necklace, which IÂ think I\'ve seen him wear pretty much everyday since I\'ve been here.Â  I\'m not going to start blabbing about my thankfulness in a blog entry he\'ll never read, but wow, what a nice guy.Â  We ended the night talking about all the great future projects we could do for Arcoiris using more technology like the website.Â  In a way all this makes me want to stay even more, but if IÂ think about it it just brings a better conclusion to my trip.Â  I\'m ready to leave, and now IÂ can just start thinking about when I come back.\n</p>\n<p>Â \nIÂ head out tomorrow, though IÂ still have some unfinished business left in Loja, so it will probably end up being later in the day.Â  My host family is coming back tomorrow, so I\'m going to wait around to thank them one last time.Â  I\'m also going to see Luis and Paola, and I should see Ãngel and Arcoiris Paola one more time as well.Â  Then I begin my 3 day or so trip to Quito at my first stop, Cuenca.\n</p>\n<p>\nI\'ll continue writing though, so this isn\'t quite my final post from Ecuador yet.\n</p>'),(45,43,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/46.php','Thank You','2009-07-28T00:00:00Z','2010-09-18T12:48:32Z','Travel','<p><style type=\"text/css\">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in;

you can preview emails, read RSS feeds, see Facebook statuses, etc.Â  You really have a lot of customization here with how you set up your desktop, too.Â  All other apps are kept in a slide out drawer, shown by simple icons.Â  And as is commonly brought up as a problem for the iPhone, Android can run multiple apps at once.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe camera is decent.Â  Definitely don\'t forget your point and shoot at home, but this camera will take some decent phone wallpapers or pictures acceptable for Facebook uploading.Â  Don\'t expect anything to look real pretty, though, ifÂ  you shoot some scene you want to get a really good picture of, you\'ll be wincing at the almost good quality of the image.Â  Also just as comparison, remembering back when 5 megapixel point and shoots were the top of the line, the pictures that those cameras took were much clearer than the ones this phone takes.Â  Which is to be expected I guess.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe GPS I have not tested extensively enough to really critique.Â  It works, and it will get you around town or to your destination on a road trip (don\'t expect turn-by-turn Google Maps Navigation yet though, it\'s not on Android 1.5).Â  I think the real test for accuracy is geocaching, and I hopefully will test that out at somepoint soon.Â  Also, keep in mind that to use Google Maps with GPS outside of wifi coverage you will need a data plan.Â  There is no preloaded app with local map data, though I wouldn\'t be surprised if a good one existed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have no glaring nags about the little things with this phone, and I think it was designed with care.Â  You won\'t accidentally unlock your phone and start butt dialing people, you can get to the camera quickly, it feels solid and looks good.Â  One of the small features that I really like is a switch on the side that can switch between two ringer modes of your choice (silent and vibrate for me, I never really have my ringer on).Â  That way you always know, by looking at a physical switch, whether your phone is going to go off in the middle of a class or not.Â  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe touchscreen is probably not as good as an iPhone\'s, and I often mistype when texting on the touch keyboard.Â  Thankfully there is a physical keyboard also, which makes that not too much of an issue.Â  This keyboard works well, with a full D pad that is nice for games.Â  Just to nitpick, the numbers are horizontal instead of in typical square block phone style, and being along the top row near the screen makes them somewhat hard to reach.Â  Also, the \'oh\' and zero keys are right next to each other, which can be confusing.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn to the real problems.Â  The processor is very slow.Â  It will often lag badly just messing with the home screen.Â  Apps will sometimes freeze and give you aÂ \"Wait\" or \"Force Close\" option box.Â  \nThis can be very annoying, though for me it\'s not quite a game breaker.Â  I would stray from this phone because of this issue, but it doesn\'t in anyway make the phone a pain to use.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother issue is the battery life.Â  If you don\'t charge this phone every night it will die.Â  It has just enough life to make it through a day and not be a huge problem.Â  I tend to spend huge amounts of time away from home at a time though (often 12+ hours), so do keep this in mind.Â  I find that only during the days where I really spend long times away, or really use battery intensive features of the phone, does it die.Â  But having my phone die on me after charging it the whole night before was surprising to me when I could sometimes forget to charge my Blackberry and still use it for two days straight.\n</p>\n<p>\nLooking at our other options,Â  the Motorola Droid is the clearly superior version of this phone.Â  However, it\'s not on T Mobile, which leads us to the Nexus One.Â  This phone has a much faster processor, which I assume would easily addrss the lag problems.Â  It also supports the latest versions of Android.Â  It does lack a physical keyboard, however, but unless this is a huge necessity for you I would go with the Nexus One (or Droid on a different carrier).Â  It has a different screen altogether, so I would assume that the touch issues with the CLIQ would not transfer directly to the Nexus One.Â  It also has the most clever name I\'ve ever heard.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll in all, the phone is nice, it works, and the drawbacks do not make it unusable in any way.Â  If you\'re getting one regardless, smile. But if you\'re looking around for the absolute best choice, I would probably look elsewhere.\n</p>'),(49,49,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/49.php','First Impressions of Austria','2010-08-04 17:41:27','','Travel','<p>I have already been in Austria for almost 3 weeks so it is long due that IÂ write someting about it.Â  I am here in Graz, Austria, working a computer engineering job at the Graz University of Technology that I got through AIESEC.Â  I\'ll be here until the very beginning of September.Â  I live in an apartment downtown with two roommates, one of which is an AIESECer.Â  I\'m having an awesome time.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst about the city, Graz is the second largest city in Austria next to Vienna, and it\'s located in Styria.Â  It\'s not too big though, somewhere between Las Vegas and Ann Arbor on my scale.Â  It has great public transportation, a nice park in the center, and tons of old historic buildings.Â  A big river called the MÃ¼r runs through the center of it.Â  One big hill with a clocktower called the SchloÃŸberg is in the center, with a few other hills around the city.Â  It has an interesting unique style (compared to my experience in the US and Ecuador) that gives the city a really nice feel.Â  I\'ll try to get to the attractions, where I\'ve been, and what IÂ think later, but first impressions are I really like Graz.\n</p>\n<p>\nI\'ve been pretty busy since I arrived, so I\'ll try to catch up with what I\'ve been doing.Â  The day after I arrived in Graz, I headed on my first trip to go see another Austrian city called Salzburg.Â  One of the AIESECers I met here invited me along, and I decided to take up the opportunity even though IÂ hadn\'t even come close to settling into Graz yet.Â  We took the train out, which was very cheap and convenient and we really need something like this out West in the US.Â  \n</p>\n<p>\nSalzburg is a very historic \'fairy tale\' type of town.Â  It has a lot of historic buildings, streets, and churches.Â  One of the biggest attractions is a huge medieval fortress on top of a hill in the center of town.Â  This was the main thing that we got to see while there, and it was very interesting for me.Â  It took until the time that IÂ was actually up there in the castle checking out all the awesome medieval stuff that I finally realized I was in Europe.Â  I always thought of Europe as that place to the East, where I will probably go at one point for a vacation when I\'m like 50, but don\'t get too excited till then.Â  Now all of a sudden I find a job in Austria and I\'m standing in a castle a few weeks later.Â  After spending most of my childhood (ok and college) playing games involving kings and knights, seeing the castle at Salzburg was a huge \'whoa I\'m in Austria\' moment for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy first week of work was short for me, since the research group that I work for had been planning a hiking trip that Thursday and Friday.Â  Luckily I was just in time to tag along, and after three days of getting to know people and being introduced to my projects we all left to go hiking.Â  We went to Dachstein, the tallest mountain in Styria at 2997m I believe.Â  I was kind of expecting a nice leisurely hike around on the mountain, but it wound up being pretty intense.Â  Most of the hiking took place on a glacier, as in ice and snow, there was even a ski lift still open in the middle of summer where we left from.Â  First we climbed up to the peak by hiking a bit through the snow then actually rock climbing with ropes and all to the top (and we actually made it to a full 3000 meters by climbing up a big metal cross at the peak).Â  After that we hiked back down and out across the glacier with ropes tied between all of us for crevasse protection, so if one person were to fall in the others can pull him out.Â  We reached the cabin we would be staying in for the night, which was out in the middle of nowhere next to a cool old monastery.Â  There we slept all in one room with other campers in really wide bunk beds that fit about 7 people per bed.Â  In the morning we started our hike back a slightly different way but were overtaken by fog about halfway, and finished the last leg hiking with hardly any visibility across the glacier.Â  Overall it was really fun, it was a crazy hike across a landscape I had never even seen before.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe got back on Friday night and went straight to sleep, but I had more fun things to do for the rest of the weekend.Â  Two more AIESEC interns from Linz came in the morning, and me and a couple other locals toured around Graz.Â  I hadn\'t really seen a lot of the city yet so it was all new for me.Â  We saw the famous SchloÃŸberg tower mentioned before, which actually used to be part of a larger fortress defending Graz that was previously destroyed.Â  The history is that Napoleon invaded Austria and layed siege to Graz, trying to conquer the fortress but never succeeding.Â  \n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately he did succeed in Vienna, and in the peace treaty they signed the Austrians agreed to demolish the fortress in Graz since Napoleon didn\'t want to have to fight against it again in the case of another war.Â  The proud Graz people negotiated a deal to keep the clocktower standing as a symbol however, so it still exists today.Â  That night we stayed at an Austrian AIESECer\'s parents\' house outside of Graz, which was really nice to get a taste of how local familes live.Â  In the morning we continued our tour of the Graz area, seeing the oddly shaped Kunsthaus modern art museum as well as a palace called Schloss Eggenberg.Â  We ate dinner at a buschenschank, which is a restaurant/farm that grows a lot of the food that it serves.Â  After seeing everything I finally had a much better idea of the city I was living in, though even now IÂ feel like I don\'t know half of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow that we\'re catching up to current times, this past weekend I was able to travel again.Â  IÂ went with the Austrian AIESECers to the Central European Congress, an international AIESEC conference in GyÃ¶r, Hungary.Â  I didn\'t get to see too much of GyÃ¶r or Hungary in my short time there, but IÂ did manage to get a lot out of the conference.Â  I was the only American there, but I met a ton of people from all over.Â  I unexpecedly had to represent the US in a cultural \'global village\' we had, but I managed to throw together a decent USA booth using random things from my suitcase and a coke bottle from the bar next door. \n</p>\n<p>\nSo, that is what IÂ have been up to in my time here in Austria.Â  I will try to stay on top of writing here now that I\'m all caught up.Â  Tomorrow it\'s back to work on my second project since I\'ve been here.\n</p>'),(50,51,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/entries/51.php','And We\'re Back','2010-10-02T18:32:15Z','2010-10-02T18:32:15Z','Websites','<p>The website is pretty much back to normal

be able to do this by typing</p>\r\n<p><code>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;\"> </span></code></p>\r\n<p>But, if you can\'t find the right package, just Google it, the exact names change all the time.</p>\r\n<p>Now you\'ll need to open port 25565, the default port used by  Minecraft.&nbsp; This port in NOT open by default, so you won\'t be able to  connect to your server without opening it.&nbsp; Fortunately you can open it  quite simply using <code>iptables</code>, the linux kernel firewall.&nbsp; Just type the following lines:</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\r\n/sbin/iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 25565 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\r\nservice iptables save\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Finally, copy <code>minecraft_server.jar </code>over to whatever directory you want on your server.&nbsp; This is the file you get from <code>http://minecraft.net/download.jsp</code>, if you\'ve paid for the game of course.&nbsp; Now you can use the command to start the server that Notch gives on the same page:</p>\r\n<p><code>java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui</code></p>\r\n<p>As long as the responses coming back on the terminal show the server  starting, you are set to connect to your server.&nbsp; Open up Minecraft, go  to multiplayer, and type in your ip address.&nbsp; You should connect and be  playing on the server.&nbsp; Give some friends your ip address to joing and  have fun.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Troubleshooting:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If you are still having problems connecting, you may want to try  rebooting your server to make sure it opens port 25565 correctly.&nbsp;  Opening this port was my biggest problem in getting my server started.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>In case you get errors saying \'can\'t reserve enough space on the  heap\', you can scale back the two memory values and write something  like:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><code>java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui</code></p>\r\n<p>Which will allow the server to start, but it may not run all that smoothly on less RAM.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If your server is running behind a router, opening port 25565 in  iptables probably won\'t be enough.&nbsp; You\'ll need to forward that port in  your router, which you might be able to accomplish with the help of <a href=\"http://www.portforward.com/\">portforward.com</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>'),(53,54,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/index.php?entry=53','Blog Fixed','2011-08-06 18:00:00','','Websites','\n<p>\nAfter far too long, I\'ve finally had enough time to sit down and work on bringing this blog back to life.  It\'s been a tough last year of university and I haven\'t had much time to work on this, but now that I don\'t have homework to eat up every second of my life I\'ve been able to work a bit on some more stuff for fun.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe blog is in the most basic form possible right now.

It was Peruvian independence day on July 28th, so we had a 4 day weekend and most of us interns\nplanned a trip to Huaraz, a town in the Andes north-east of Lima.  \n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz0.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nFirst I\'ll start with ChavÃ­n, an archaeological site we got to see (\n<a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav%C3%ADn_de_Huantar\">Wikipedia article</a>\n).  Apparently it\'s a UNESCO heritage site now that I look at that Wikipedia article, pretty cool...  Anyway, it\'s an old religious site from ~1500BC, so way before the Incas and everything.  You can see the sunken square plaza behind me where apparently they sacrificed animals (and maybe people), with the big temple building in the background.  A lot of it is covered in grass and soil and just looks like a hill now, but it\'s being excavated right now in a lot of places.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz1.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nThis is a detail of the main temple wall you could see far behind me in the first picture.  The alternating big stone, small stone pattern is to help resist earthquakes, which apparently it does a good job of since it has been standing for 3500 years in a very earthquake prone region.  Also if you look closely in the top right of the picture, where you can see the highest parts of the wall, you can tell the people who built this got better at cutting stones as the years went by in construction.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz2.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nMe inside the awesome ancient temple (after waiting in a 2 hour long line).  Lots of really cool tight dark passages in here, no big rooms really, and the ceiling was really low.  I felt a little bit like Indiana Jones, even though there was a giant line of tourists outside.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz3.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nA pretty bad picture of the stone god statue in the center of the temple.  The room it\'s in is cross shaped, and still very tight and cramped as you can kind of tell.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz4.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nThis was one of my favorite parts, and sorry for another bad picture.  As you can kind of see behind the rope (really bad picture), there are two snake heads coming down and kind of pointing to the side.  That\'s because the stairs lead up to the main temple from the main walkway from the square plaza, and after a ceremony when everyone was walking by, the snakes told the commoners to keep walking and not head up to the temple where only the nobles where allowed.  I just thought that was really cool comparing that to similar simbols we have nowadays.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz5.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nReview: here\'s a miniature model of the whole site without all the dirt covering it.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz6.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nOn to another day of the trip when we traveled to the national park with highest peak in Peru, HuascarÃ¡n.  Here\'s another\n<a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huascar%C3%A1n\">Wikipedia article</a>\njust to prove these are real places I guess.  It\'s also the highest peak in the world that\'s in a tropical region; you can tell from the picture that the temperature is still pretty mild where I was standing, not that far from the snowy peak.  We were driving around in our tour bus on the dirt roads up there at this point, and from here we went into the canyon to the right of the peaks.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz7.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nSo here we\'re inside the canyon at this cool lagoon with big mountains on each side.  I could see glacier type snow only a short hike up from here and still it wasn\'t too cold.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz8.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nAnother day and back to the same national park, but coming up the other side.  The peak in the background is a different one from yesterday, there were a ton of them around.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz9.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nWe kept climbing in altitude and got up to these big open grasslands.  A few shepherds live really sparsley in huts around here, but other than that there really is nothing.  Some of the shepherd kids dressed up their sheep and were charging tourists to take a picture with them whenever a bus stopped.  You can see cows faintly in the background of this picture, and the pool in the foreground is a really deep and clear spring.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz10.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nNearby the only plants that grew besides grass were these huge yucca type things.  They bloom by sprouting those stalks out of the top of them and then die.  And our tour guide said they supposedly only bloom during a lunar eclipse...\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz11.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nWe parked a little big up the road from the last picture and then hiked a bit to this glacier at around 5000m of altitude.  There were pretty much no plants here this high, just rock and snow.  Some people rode horses up to this point instead of hiking, and I was jealous because the altitude was killing me.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz12.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nOk there was at least one plant.  This is my attempt at a fancy picture using a point and shooot camera.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz13.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nwe headed back down to Huaraz after the glacier, this is our hotel room.  No heater but plenty of blankets on the bed.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz14.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nThis is the view from the roof of our hotel.  Yes that\'s an owl.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/huaraz15.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nAnd lastly, since we did come down for independence day, this picture was taken at an independence day parade at a town right next to Huaraz.\n<p>\n<br>\n<p>\nThat was my trip for the first time I\'ve gotten to go outside Lima since arriving.  Hopefully I\'ll get to see more of Peru!  In the meantime I need to post lots more about my trip in general, should be up soon...\n</p>\n'),(55,56,'http://www.justinmccandless.com/index.php?entry=55','To Lima','2011-10-10 18:00:00','','Travel','\n<p>\nIt has been my goal to work abroad after gradaution since I started thinking about what I would do after graduation.  I spent awhile looking for a good internship abroad during my senior year and after graduation, where I could develop my technical skills, learn about business in another country, and have the cultural and language immersion that you can only get abroad.  I would have been happy to go almost anywhere in the world, but month or so after graduation I found myself with this offer from Telefonica in Lima, not too far from where I did my first internship in Ecuador.  The job seemed to be the exact kind of thing that would get me to come back to Latin America.  I could work at a large company in a big city for a moderate amount of time and get the opposite side of the experience I had in Ecuador two years ago, while being immersed in a way I couldn\'t by starting fresh in a new part of the world.  I was a bit thrown off to go from a big job search to actually having an appealing offer, but I decided to cash in and take it.\n</p>\n<img src = \"http://www.justinmccandless.com/uploads/images/toLima0.jpg\" alt = \"Image Not Found\">\n<p>\nA month or so later I had moved all of my things from the past four years out of my apartment in Michigan back home to Vegas and was saying goodbye to my family and flying to Lima.  And here I\'ve been for the past 3 months.\n</p>\n<p>\nI\'m an intern in software development at Telefonica.  Most of my coworkers manage the development of internal software systems since actual coding is done by third-party consulting companies, but I get to be an actual developer on one project as well as manage a group of consultants in another.  I work from 9 to 4 on a good day (with a long lunch starting at 1).  The internship started at the very beginning of July, and my last day of work is in early December.  There are 8 other interns here working for Telefonica through AIESEC as well, from a bunch of different countries (Colombia, Mexico, Bulgaria, France, Spain).  We all work in different areas, most in different buildings, but we have a really cool group to hang out with after work.\n</p>\n<p>\nI live with 2 Colombian interns in a 3 bedroom apartment in Surco, a more residential district of Lima.  The location is more out of the way, but it is one of the nicer places to live.  There are tons of parks within walking distance, and little stores and restaurants on every corner as always.  Two bigger supermarkets are a few blocks away, as well as a KFC and a McDonalds.  \n</p>\n<p>\nI work in Surquillo, a less nice district, in the same building as one of my roommates.  It seems to be kind of in the shadow of one of Lima\'s nicer skyscraper filled districts.  There are plenty of restaurants around though, and it\'s not too far from things, so it\'s not too bad.  It takes me about 40 minutes to get to work every morning from my apartment using the crazy private bus system in Lima.\n</p>\n<p>\nI\'ve been very fortunate once again to be supported by an incredible AIESEC chapters, from the University of the Pacific here.  These guys are one of the most well-oiled LCs I\'ve seen, and they have gone well out of their way to help me multiple times.  One AIESECer took an afternoon off work on two different days to walk me through the most awful bureacratic process ever to receive a package my dad sent me.  They have made me feel much more at home in this huge city.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlright, I just wanted to give a quick update about what brought me out here and what I\'m doing.  I have a lot more written about Lima and some trips and other things going on, which I\'ll post soon.\n</p>\n');
