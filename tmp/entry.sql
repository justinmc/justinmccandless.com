I just talked about the day I spent volunteering through work in the <a href = "http://www.justinmccandless.com/index.php?entry=57">previous post</a>, but I wanted to talk about some more cultural stuff from the day as well (since I am in another country).

One of the main things I wanted to mention was just the difference in how my workmates treated the underprivileged kids compared to how I feel like it would go in the US.  Firstly, they seemed to be just showering the kids in positive reinforcement.  From when they first arrived and we all cheered them in, and practically served them food, to later going through the offices everyone we ran into was loading them down with any pens, notebooks, food, etc. that they could find.  It seemed like a lot of positivity when Americans might be more conscious about "spoiling" them or giving them too much.  Also, many of my coworkers seemed to take less of a friend or authority role, and instead be more like a parent, and almost lecture the kids about the most basic stuff.  I heard the most typical things said to the kids like "Stay in school", "Don\'t play with matches", "Have faith in God even if your parents don\'t", etc., and me as an American felt like this would be seen as stepping on the parent\'s toes and doing their job in an overly forward way in the US.  Note that the religious comment obviously has a much different feel here in Peru where the vast majority of the people and the schools are Catholic (including this school), but it still seemed like they were preaching to these kids they just met like they won\'t get it anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
This could have been affected by the fact that the kids were not like the neighbor\'s kids or something, they were from a very poor area outside of Lima.  I was told most parents worked in furniture factories and the like by my coworkers, but I\'m not personally familiar with the area.  Some of them had fairly beat up back packs or shoes, but it wasn\'t horribly obvious by hanging out with them.  My "little brother" in particular did have it bad though, he was missing about half of one of his fingers and his upper lip area was dented inward so that it was pretty hard to understand his speech.  I couldn\'t tell if it was a birth defect or it had been caused later in life.  He got by fine though, and he seemd to be accepted like normal by the other kids.
</p>
<p>
These were just a few interesting things I noticed while volunteering and wanted to write about.  I had a ton of fun volunteering here, and I hope we gave the kids an awesome day.  For me, it was an incredible experience being able to see and participate in something like this, not just back in Las Vegas but in another country!

Speaking a new language and dealing with ignorance
<p>
During my four months in Ecuador, my first time outside the US, a lot of excitement was surrounding my first experience speaking another language.  Whenever I could walk to the store and make myself understood as I went through the checkout line, it was pretty fun and motivational overcoming the fear of actually trying to do something like that.  Towards the end of the trip I started to get a lot more comfortable with my Spanish, and 
</p>
<p>
I remember a Spanish professor in college, who was from Cuba, talking about life as a foreigner in the US.  One time he told a simple story along the lines of being in line at the grocery store, and having the kid at the counter ask for his ID for his credit card when he asked none of the several preceding white American customers.  My professor chewed the kid out, refused to show his ID, and called the manager over.  As a student in the class I understood my professor\'s side and thought that the kid was stupid for doing that whether his intentions were ill or not, but I still didn\'t think my professor was justified in causing such a big scene out of something so subtle.  Now here in Lima years later I understand everything he must have been feeling.  As a foreigner who wants nothing more than to fit in, being reminded that you are different, that people think differently of you, and in this case that people think NEGATIVELY of you amplifies the situation a million times and makes you feel so terrible.  I have felt the urge to react much more strongly to situations much more subtle than this, and now I think that if I had been in line behind my professor that day then I would have had his back in a heartbeat.  For what it\'s worth, the manager wound up being an old student of my professor\'s, so his complaint was heard and my professor won that one.
</p>

<p>
As negative as this post may have sounded, things like this actually just remind me why I am here in Lima.  The understanding that I have gained here will be with me for the rest of my life and will be something I share with anyone I run into who seems out of place.  And when I do, I will always be the person who makes them feel a little bit closer to home.

Last weekend I was able to travel again so I need to write about it!  This trip was with a bunch of our interns here to Ica in the desert south of Lima.  Nazca, where the Nazca lines are, is in this area.  I was really excited about these, but you pretty much have to take a plane to see them so I wasn't able to.  We did wind up seeing another similar petroglyph though nearby...

This is on a hill facing the ocean outside of Paracas (~50km inland from Ica).  People actually don't know who made it, some say the indigenous culture nearby, others say sailors used it as a landmark after the Spanish came.  It is significantly deeper than the Nazca lines, and not in the same area as those.  It's supposed to be a cactus which is believed to have medicinal properties from the region.  You can see how barren the desert is here, there is not a plant to be seen.  Our guide said that the reason the picture hasn't been erased is because it probably hasn't rained here since it was made.

We did go on a boat to see that cactus drawing, but the main attraction wasn't that, it was the Islas Ballestas.
