<p>
Another important yet neglected topic.  I've posted a bit about Loja before, but now I have some pictures to go along
with it.

This is a cool park near the house.  Note the llamas.  You can sort of see one of the rivers that runs through town
in the picture.  There's a dam that makes a small lake in it for this park.  Lots of typical houses and stuff in the
background, as well as that castle that I went to earlier up on the mountain on the left.  I really need to go back
to that castle with my camera so I can take pictures of the city by the way...

Obligatory Loja picture.  This is the clock tower in San Sebasti&aacute;n plaza.  It's in a pretty popular area downtown,
with lots of shops and stuff surrounding it.  The pictures on the base of the tower comemorate Loja gaining it's
independence from Spain.

A typical downtown street near San Sebasti&aacute;n.  And some cars.  You can see a bit of the mountains that surround Loja
in the background.  The building to the right is a really nice church, well, the side of it.

And lastly we have some sunset scenery from outside of Loja.  This is what the typical terrain around the city is like.
The picture was taken at the

that I went to the other weekend.  That's Conan towards the bottom.

Ok, writing this post about Loja actually just reinforced what I said at the beginning.  I have neglected Loja too
much and I need to take more pictures of it, because I don't have much more than these four here.  I'm still missing
big landmarks like the Parque Central, and Jipiro...  I'll get on that.
