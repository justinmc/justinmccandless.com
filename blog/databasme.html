Yes, I actually did get the website updates to the server as promised.  I'm pretty sure there are a few bugs, and I'm definitely sure that there
are a few things that I need to do better.  But we'll worry about that later.  For now just take a look around and enjoy the incredible
improvement over the old site.

Quick tour.  If you'll take a look at the Categories section in the bar to the right, you'll notice that I've divided up all of my posts into
different sections.  This should make it easier to keep track of only what you want to read about since I generally post on a large variety
of topics.

The archive is greatly improved now as well (and automatically updates itself, I might add).  Also, each category has its own specific archive 
that displays only the posts related to that category.
</p>
<p>
The newsbar to the right is a much needed addition as well.  In category specific pages it displays all of the most recent entries from that
category, while on more general pages all recent posts are displayed.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if you'll look towards the bottom of the page you'll see a nav button or two.  These allow you to go to the next and previous posts
(or newest and oldest posts) without having to swap back and forth between entry and archive.  Brilliant, I don't know how I come up with these
things.

Well, I'll post a more technical rundown of it all once I get everything running the way I want.  I'll also be posting some pictures and a few
things about Ecuador probably early next week.  Well, as long as I don't have to go to Quito to beg for more time in Ecuador (which I still
don't completely know about).
