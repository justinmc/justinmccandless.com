         So I registered www.justinmccandless.com a while back when I registered another domain, 				 	
         and it just kind of sat for a while without much on it.  Now that I'm sitting here bored in a cabin 	
         in Utah in the middle of nowhere, I guess I'm turning it into my blog.  I plan to just post my 			
         thoughts on the world whenever I get a chance, and probably my opinions on games, music,				  	
         movies, tech, or whatever I feel like talking about.  If I end up having any readers: Hope you enjoy.
